Yes, Gorilla is an online platform used to design, build, and run
experiments in the field of psychology, neuroscience, and related
disciplines. It enables researchers to develop a wide variety of
experiments, including surveys, response time tasks, and more complex
designs.

Here are some steps to create an experiment in Gorilla:

1.  Sign up and log in: Visit the Gorilla website (https://gorilla.sc/)
    and sign up for an account. Log in to access the platform.

2.  Create a new project: Navigate to the 'My Projects' tab on the top
    bar, and click on 'Create Project.' Provide a name and description
    for your project.

3.  Design your experiment: In the 'Project Workspace,' you will find
    three main components: Task Builder, Questionnaire Builder, and
    Experiment Tree. Use the Task Builder to create custom tasks by
    dragging and dropping elements onto the screen. For example, you can
    add text, images, videos, or response options. You can also create
    questionnaires using the Questionnaire Builder, which allows you to
    add multiple question types, like multiple choice, Likert scales,
    and free text responses.

4.  Set up experiment flow: Use the Experiment Tree to structure your
    experiment by adding nodes for tasks, questionnaires, and
    instructions. You can also create different conditions, randomize
    the order of tasks, and set up counterbalancing rules.

5.  Preview your experiment: Click on 'Preview' to test your experiment
    and ensure that everything is working as intended. Be sure to test
    the flow of the experiment, timings, and the data collected.

6.  Launch the experiment: Once you are satisfied with your experiment,
    click on 'Launch' to recruit participants. You can either recruit
    your own participants or use Gorilla's participant pool. Gorilla
    allows you to manage participant data, set up quotas, and track
    progress through the experiment.

7.  Analyze your data: After your experiment is completed, you can
    download your data in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON). Import your
    data into your preferred analysis software (e.g., R, Python, SPSS)
    to analyze your results.

Remember to follow ethical guidelines and obtain approval from an
Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee before conducting
any experiment involving human participants.
