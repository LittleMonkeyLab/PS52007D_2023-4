This will be discussed in a number of lectures, but it\ncontributes to effective learning and your integration of the skills and\nexperience of doing this research exercise.\n\n## Time management and teamwork\n\n..will both be required.\n\nI ask you to see both as an opportunity to develop these important\nskills.\n\nYou will see we have some ideas to make this more relevant to careers\nand employability\n\nIt is easier to 'keep up than to catch up'.\n\n## Resources\n\nWe will be releasing a series of valuable resources to help you through\nevery step of the process\n\nThese will have value for your final year dissertation too.\n\nContribution to and comment on these is welcome and hoped for!\n\nOpen Educational Resources will be used extensively, and most core\nreadings are available online via the library.\n\n## Before tomorrow, please...\n\nAdd an email signature to your college email, including your student\nnumber, programme, lab tutor, and personal tutor. It will speed up\nresponses to any emails you send to staff.\n\n## Lectures Term One\n\n![](images/Term1 Lectures.png)\n\n## Lectures Term Two\n\n![](images/Term2 Lectures.png)\n\n## Labs Term One\n\n![](images/Term1 Labs.png)\n\n## Labs Term Two\n\n![](images/Term2 labs.png)\n\n## Mini-Dissertation structure\n\nYour individual Mini-Dissertation project **MUST** conform to the\nfollowing definitive rules:\n\n::: nonincremental\n-   **2x2 ANOVA design with 2 categorical IVs (each with 2 levels) and a\n    single continuous DV**\n-   **You must obtain ethical approval and show individual involvement\n    in the process of application**\n-   **You must make a sample size estimation / Power calculation**\n-   **You must contribute to group recruitment and data collection\n    efforts either online or in-person**\n:::\n\n## Mini-Dissertation Submission\n\n**Your Mini-Dissertation final submission must comprise ALL of the\nfollowing COMPULSORY elements:**\n\n::: nonincremental\n-   a 2,500 word APA7 empirical paper with a complete reference list and\n    appendices\n-   Open Data - a single, cleaned, clearly-labelled data set\n-   Open Materials - a complete, replication-ready materials package\n    detailing materials relevant to your individual write-up\n-   A reflective account covering the Mini-Dissertation (not a moan\n    about your group or strikes or having to do research)\n:::\n\n## Illustrative MD topics\n\n::: nonincremental\n-   The effect of gender stereotype and task difficulty on memory\n    performance\n-   The role of facial symmetry and filter type on ratings of\n    attractiveness of online dating profile pictures\n-   Exposure to negative news media, trait anxiety and the BAME\n    community under COVID-19\n-   The effects of Agentic and Communal Narcissism, attitudes towards\n    COVID-19 and lockdown compliance\n-   The effect of personality and sleep disturbance on academic\n    performance\n-   Need for cognition, pre-sentencing information and perceptions of\n    guilt in a jury decision making task\n:::\n\n## But let's deep dive this one\n\n[**The effect of Conscientiousness and Caffeine intake on Academic\nSelf-Handicapping**]{.takeaway}\n\n::: incremental\n-   *The effect of Independent Variable A and Independent Variable B on\n    a continuous Dependent Variable* \n-   Conscientiousness IV(A1) Low or IV(A2) high - Independent Variable\n    IV(A)\n-   Caffeine intake IV(B1) Low or IV(B2) high - Independent Variable\n    IV(B)\n-   Academic Self-Handicapping (6 item 1-5 Likert style, 'continuous'\n    Dependent Variable DV)\n-   What about the other 3 people in the group?\n:::\n\n## Rest of the group:\n\n[**The effect of Conscientiousness and Caffeine intake on Academic\nSelf-Handicapping**]{.takeaway} \n\n::: incremental\n1.
