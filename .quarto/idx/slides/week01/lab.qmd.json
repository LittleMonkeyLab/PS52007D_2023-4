The only things that will EVER be\ncompulsory are short administrative tasks on a roughly fortnightly basis\n(group progress update) and the next activity.

Some ideas will be discussed, and a discussion\nabout the Lab Challenge might prompt some ideas.\n\n## Goal Alignment and Group Ethos\n\nAnother aspect of effective Group work is Goal Alignment. Even if you\nare working with your best buddy, they may want to just get in and out,\nwhile you want to immerse yourself in the task ahead.\n\nThis would be a conflict that is potentially dangerous.
