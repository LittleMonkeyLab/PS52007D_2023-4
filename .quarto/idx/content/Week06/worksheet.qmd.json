Do you all still agree on your original research question\n    or how you thought you'd explore it? Have your ideas developed in\n    any way? List your preferred IVs, DVs, and methodologies and compare\n    notes. Look out for similarities and differences.\n\n    It is normal that your approaches or interests may diverge a little\n    as a result of your critical evaluations. This is great. If not,\n    that's fine too. The design of your individual Mini-Dissertation\n    needs to be slightly different from your collaborators, so you can\n    pursue your interests if they differ somewhat.\n\n    Exploring different personality traits is a nice way to find\n    distinctive IVs. If you are presenting stimulus materials, you could\n    present different types, classes, or categories. An exploration of\n    memory may include familiar or unfamiliar words, short or long\n    words, or focus on another type of stimulus, such as numbers or\n    shapes, different presentation durations, or recall delays. Or you\n    could use different DVs, such as accuracy/error rate, or reaction\n    time, or confidence; all interesting. If you are looking at\n    life-outcomes as a DV (as many of you are), these can vary by domain\n    (e.g. work or home-life) or how you quantify them; how do you\n    quantify success or happiness or health? It may initially seem quite\n    tricky to see how this might work, but your lab tutor is on hand to\n    help!\n\n2.  **Sharing the workload:** Following on from the question above, is\n    there a 'central' task, measure, or stimulus-set in your project\n    that potentially requires more effort to find or build? Does some\n    aspect of your project involve the selection or creation of stimulus\n    material?\n\n    This might be a good thing to develop as a group, allowing you to\n    make it as effective as possible. This is likely the core of your\n    methods section and worth making fabulous. You can then duplicate\n    this component and break into smaller groups to tailor it and\n    collect the data if you need to or want to. But by working together\n    as much as possible, you can refine this component and make it as\n    accurate and impressive as possible with relative ease.\n\n## Opening a Goldsmiths Qualtrics Account\n\n1.  Please go to this link: [Goldsmiths\n    Qualtrics](https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/)\n\n2.  Use your college email address and password.

You will know if you have been successful if, when you log in, the\n    URL starts with goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com.\n\n## Importing the Mini-Dissertation Template\n\n1.  Download the Mini-Dissertation Qualtrics Template\n    [HERE](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=1410096) or\n    from the VLE page.\n\n2.  It will be a .qsf file, native to Qualtrics, and will only open in\n    Qualtrics.\n\n3.  To use the template, on the Homepage, click on 'Create a new\n    project', select 'Survey', and 'Get started'.\n\n    ![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000234.png)\n\n4.  Give your project a preliminary name (this can be changed later) and\n    choose 'Import a QSF file' from the 'How you want to start'\n    dropdown.\n\n    ![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000238.png)\n\n5.  Find the .qsf file you downloaded earlier using the 'Choose file'\n    finder and then click 'Create project'.\n\n6.  You will likely be offered the option to 'Take a tour' of the Survey\n    Builder. It takes two minutes and shows you how to change settings\n    and to edit questions.\n\n    ![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000240.png)\n\n## The Template\n\nPlease notice that, over and above the survey questions, the template\nincludes four important elements; 1) an Information Sheet outlining the\nstudy, 2) Informed Consent, 3) GDPR, and 4) a Debrief delivered at the\nend of the survey.\n\nYou are required to submit copies of the information you supply in these\nsections in word doc format with your Ethics Application for storage on\nfile. Simply copy the content in the relevant sections of your Qualtrics\nsurvey into 4 separate word documents for submission.\n\nNB: If you run an experiment in person (this year OR next), you will be\nrequired to give each participant a hard copy of all of these documents\nand retain a signed Consent Form for your records. The process of\ndeveloping these materials is valuable preparation - please be involved.\n\nOnce you've created your survey, you're ready to start building. This\npage outlines how to add, delete, copy, and edit multiple questions in\nthe Survey tab to build your required functionality. The Qualtrics help\nis extremely useful and gives extensive, easily-navigable help.\n\nFor example, you will want to add new questions into the body of the\nsurvey, corresponding with demographic information or a psychometric\nmeasure or questionnaire you have found.\n\n## New Questions in your Survey\n\nThis page is very useful to help select the best question type. There\nare many types, but you will find Matrix Tables, Multiple Choice, and\nSliders particularly useful. You can present images, media and text by\nusing the Text/Graphic options and Rich Text Editor.\n\n-   [Creating New Questions in\n    Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/creating-questions/?parent=p0030#AddingNewQuestions)\n\nTry to make the questions as easy to navigate as possible. Remember to\nuse page breaks to make the flow more enjoyable.\n\n-   [Adding Page Breaks\n    Manually](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/add-page-break/?parent=p0030#AddingPageBreaksManually)\n\nYou can use a Rich Content Editor to include more elaborate instructions\nand adding media or graphics. You can also use hyperlinks to connect to\ncontent on the web outside of your questionnaire. You might want to\ninclude a downloadable file, such as a debrief form or pdf of some\ninformation you think a participant may want to retain. This can be\nmanaged via the Rich Content Editor. Making a participant feel like they\nhave learned something can be a powerful reward. Please be careful not\nto break copyright by sharing materials you haven't produced yourself.\nIf you propose to include such materials, this should be included in\nyour Ethics Application.\n\n## Important safety and ethics considerations\n\nPlease only use your Goldsmiths Email address when running research and\nif you give your own details ALWAYS supply those of your Lab Tutor or\nthe Module Coordinator. This affords you some protection and allows us\nto help deal with any questions.\n\nIt is important that you clearly outline recruitment strategies in your\nethic application (i.e. how you propose to recruit and where you share\nyour task) and you must ONLY share an approved task.\n\n## Block Options and randomisation\n\n-   [Block Options and\n    Randomization](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/block-options/block-options-overview/?parent=p00101)\n\nSets of questions (or entire questionnaires) can be set up as 'blocks'\nwithin your survey. If you wish to randomize these blocks, you can,\nmeaning that you can randomly shuffle the sequence of presentation. This\nis an important feature that you may wish to consider using. Obviously,\nthe information and informed consent will need to remain at the start\nand the debrief needs to always be the last block presented.\n\nIn the 'survey flow' area, you will see that you can view the blocks in\nthe survey and add a randomizer, that randomly delivers a selection of\nblocks. Block 1 and 2 are identical in the template, but will be\npresented in random order for each new participant.\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000242.png)\n\n## Recoding and Scoring (Massive time savers!)\n\n### Recode Values\n\nOnce you have set up your survey, it is always a good idea to run a test\nand export the data to make sure it is in the format that you require.\nIf you notice that the data are not in the format you would most easily\nuse, it may be that you could consider 'recoding' the values to make it\neasier to use.\n\n-   [Recode Values in\n    Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/question-options/recode-values/)\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000244.png)\n\n### Scoring questionnaires\n\nScoring can save you LOTS of time, by automatically scoring your\nquestionnaires or subscales of your questionnaires. Consider using this\nif your measure generates a total score or you are planning on\ncalculating an average etc. It is perfectly easy to calculate these in\nexcel, but it can be done automatically with a little care and\npreparation.\n\n-   [Scoring in\n    Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/scoring/#Introduction)\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000246.png)\n\n## Previewing your survey\n\nIf you want to see how a question (or entire survey) looks, use the\npreview functionality. It will allow you to see what the participant\nwill see -- both on a computer and on a mobile device.\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000248.png)\n\n## Data Export\n\nIt is highly recommended that you test how the data will be exported\nfrom your survey, so that you can perfect how you label your questions\nand how you recode or score your variables. To run a quick 'data test'\ndo the following.\n\nClick Publish and label the versions 'Data Test' and click 'Publish'\nagain.\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000250.png)\n\nUnder 'Distributions' select 'Anonymous link' (which is how you will\nshare your study with participants usually. You can of course produce a\nQR code or use Bit.ly to shorten the link to make it more attractive.\nThink about the best way to recruit for your study.\n\nCopy the link to your browser and run through the study.\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000252.png)\n\nExport Data from this menu to a range of useful formats.\n\n![![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000256.png)](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000254.png)\n\nIn Term 2 we will be looking at the data and how to clean it. The most\nimportant thing I would advise you to do is to name your blocks and\nquestions clearly, so that this is reflected in the dataset that you\ndownload. If you don't know which question is which, you could come\nunstuck.\n\n## Collaborate your survey with colleagues\n\nIf you wish to share your survey with your group and work on it\ntogether, you can 'Collaborate' the project. It's like using a shared\ndocument. You can monitor versions in case you make a mistake, but\nremember to 'Publish' if you want to over-write any changes you make!\nYou can find this in the 'Tools' menu and you will need to use your\ncolleagues' Goldsmiths email addresses AND they will need to have a\nGoldsmiths Qualtrics account too.\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000258.png)\n\nFor More Information the Qualtrics website includes comprehensive and\neasy-to-follow help documentation as mentioned above.

For anything requiring complex presentation of stimuli or\ndata recording accuracies or reaction times, Gorilla would be the most\nsuitable platform to employ. Review some of the tasks they have in their\n'Samples' collection ready for cloning!\n<https://app.gorilla.sc/support/samples>\n\n**Getting your Gorilla account if you are a new user to the software\nplease follow the below guidance:**\n\nPlease go the Gorilla webpage (<https://gorilla.sc/login>), if you don't\nalready have an account create a new one, at the bottom of STEP 3 -\nfinish, you should find a box called + My institution already has a\nsubscription. Please click on this box (please see an image below for\nease) and enter the enrolment code: **PsychGold**\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000260.png)\n\n## **Support pages and other guides to get you started**\n\nThere is a fantastic set of resources available to new users\n\n<https://support.gorilla.sc/support/>\n\nWith a 'Getting Started Guide'\n<https://support.gorilla.sc/support/walkthrough/getting-started>\n\nAnd onboarding videos <https://support.gorilla.sc/support/getstarted>\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000262.png)\n\n**Gordon's Top Tip: Time spent preparing your materials really pays off\n-- in terms of time, data quality and confidence!**\n\nThis is an exciting point in term. You've critically evaluated research\nto inform your own approach to the topic. You've probably identified\nuseful measures and tasks to use in your studies. Now is the time to\nstart developing your studies for real.\n\nSome of your studies may comprise questionnaire measures and other\ndemographic or participant details. Some may involve more complex\nbehavioural tasks. Even in person studies might benefit from using\nQualtrics or a computerised task.\n\nBear in mind that you need to have completed building these BEFORE you\napply for ethics later this term. Once your materials are approved, they\ncan't be changed. Now is the time to make them as effective as possible\nin terms of the research question, but also as user-friendly as possible\n-- for you AND the participants. The quality of these materials will\ndirectly impact the quality of your data.\n\nThere will be some pragmatic decisions that you make, such as\nidentifying economical measures for variables of interest. A study that\nis too time-consuming will be unattractive and you are required to\nestimate how long a study takes to complete to participants before they\ntake part. Always consider the user experience. There is no requirement\nthat your study is long and complicated. This is a modest first research\nstudy. There is no benefit to long and complicated!\n\nAnd you should consider how user-friendly your materials are for\nparticipants and experimenter alike. Try to make the materials you\nemploy appear professional and attractive. You will be submitting your\nmaterials and they will be appraised for professionalism and\npresentation. But thinking of yourself next term, the easier it is to\noutput your data and begin your analysis, the better.\n\nTake the time to label your questions clearly and verify the data\noutputs in an intelligible format. We will cover this in later labs, but\nwhy not poke around in advance and ensure it's a smooth process! Take\nthe time to recode variables into output that you can use easily. And\nuse 'Scoring' to give you automatically produced means, totals and\nsubscales wherever possible. It will save you time and worry in Term 2!\n\nSimply put; being as confident in your materials as possible will save\nyou time and increase your confidence in the New Year (and Next Year!)\n\n**Looking forward to Third Year: Data collection and management as\nvaluable skills**\n\nYou might think that something like Qualtrics isn't a hugely valuable\nskill to learn. Well, in a high proportion of cases you'll use it next\nyear for your Final Year Dissertation, and being confident doing that is\nworthwhile in itself.\n\nBut you'd be amazed how common it is nowadays to want to survey opinion\nor attitudes. Imagine you are running a business and want to find out\nwhat your customers think about your product. Imagine you are managing\nan organization and need to understand how much time your employees\nspend on unnecessarily difficult tasks, or how they rate you as a boss.\n\nAsking questions using surveys is a quick way to generate important\ninsights, but not as easy as people think. Being able to design good\nquestions, and delivering them well, is a valuable skill.\n\nAnd once you have lots of lovely data, being able to manage those data\nwell enough to allow you to extract the important insights hiding within\nis something that very few people are able to do well... You'll be\nexpert at such things.\n\nI've already mentioned that Excel (or Numbers or Google Sheets) are\nincredibly common tools you'll probably use on a regular basis in your\nfuture lives. Contact lists, customer databases, financial results and\naccounts, stock inventories, meta-data, Gannt charts and the list goes\non. We are training you in important skills here!\n\nBeing confident manipulating and presenting data -- Data Literacy - is\nsomething you will likely wish to highlight on future CVs and you can\nbegin to develop those skills in your Mini-Dissertation, and refine and\nperfect them next year. Being confident with data will allow you to\nthink bigger about your Final Year Dissertation than if you are worried\nabout this.\n\nMany of you will be anxious about 'statistics'. I'd hope, in due course,\nthat your experience this year will help to allay those fears. But I\nbelieve the biggest anxiety students experience around 'statistics'\nisn't the statistics part of it at all. I believe that moving from raw\ndata to an analysis-ready dataset is the intimidating bit, not the few\nbutton presses in SPSS. For this reason, we have oodles of support in\nTerm 2 around how to prepare, clean, and screen your data, so that you\ncan unleash all the SPSS skills you've been learning in Design &\nAnalysis with zero stress.\n\nHave a great week.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Starting Developing Your Studies\n\n## By the end of the session, you will have:\n\n-   Worked together in your groups to determine next steps in your\n    studies; specifically, materials that are shared, and those that are\n    individual to you.

Block 1 and 2 are identical in the template, but will be\npresented in random order for each new participant.\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000242.png)\n\n## Recoding and Scoring (Massive time savers!)\n\n### Recode Values\n\nOnce you have set up your survey, it is always a good idea to run a test\nand export the data to make sure it is in the format that you require.\nIf you notice that the data are not in the format you would most easily\nuse, it may be that you could consider 'recoding' the values to make it\neasier to use.\n\n-   [Recode Values in\n    Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/question-options/recode-values/)\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000244.png)\n\n### Scoring questionnaires\n\nScoring can save you LOTS of time, by automatically scoring your\nquestionnaires or subscales of your questionnaires. Consider using this\nif your measure generates a total score or you are planning on\ncalculating an average etc. It is perfectly easy to calculate these in\nexcel, but it can be done automatically with a little care and\npreparation.\n\n-   [Scoring in\n    Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/scoring/#Introduction)\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000246.png)\n\n## Previewing your survey\n\nIf you want to see how a question (or entire survey) looks, use the\npreview functionality. It will allow you to see what the participant\nwill see -- both on a computer and on a mobile device.\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000248.png)\n\n## Data Export\n\nIt is highly recommended that you test how the data will be exported\nfrom your survey, so that you can perfect how you label your questions\nand how you recode or score your variables. To run a quick 'data test'\ndo the following.\n\nClick Publish and label the versions 'Data Test' and click 'Publish'\nagain.\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000250.png)\n\nUnder 'Distributions' select 'Anonymous link' (which is how you will\nshare your study with participants usually. You can of course produce a\nQR code or use Bit.ly to shorten the link to make it more attractive.\nThink about the best way to recruit for your study.\n\nCopy the link to your browser and run through the study.\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000252.png)\n\nExport Data from this menu to a range of useful formats.\n\n![![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000256.png)](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000254.png)\n\nIn Term 2 we will be looking at the data and how to clean it. The most\nimportant thing I would advise you to do is to name your blocks and\nquestions clearly, so that this is reflected in the dataset that you\ndownload. If you don't know which question is which, you could come\nunstuck.\n\n## Collaborate your survey with colleagues\n\nIf you wish to share your survey with your group and work on it\ntogether, you can 'Collaborate' the project. It's like using a shared\ndocument. You can monitor versions in case you make a mistake, but\nremember to 'Publish' if you want to over-write any changes you make!\nYou can find this in the 'Tools' menu and you will need to use your\ncolleagues' Goldsmiths email addresses AND they will need to have a\nGoldsmiths Qualtrics account too.\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000258.png)\n\nFor More Information the Qualtrics website includes comprehensive and\neasy-to-follow help documentation as mentioned above. Tutorials,\nwebinars and detailed directions are available via Qualtrics' extensive\nonline resource, Qualtrics Support.\n[www.qualtrics.com/support](www.qualtrics.com/support)\n\nFor fast, individualized support over chat, email or a scheduled phone\ncall, please consider using the Support Center.

For anything requiring complex presentation of stimuli or\ndata recording accuracies or reaction times, Gorilla would be the most\nsuitable platform to employ. Review some of the tasks they have in their\n'Samples' collection ready for cloning!\n<https://app.gorilla.sc/support/samples>\n\n**Getting your Gorilla account if you are a new user to the software\nplease follow the below guidance:**\n\nPlease go the Gorilla webpage (<https://gorilla.sc/login>), if you don't\nalready have an account create a new one, at the bottom of STEP 3 -\nfinish, you should find a box called + My institution already has a\nsubscription. Please click on this box (please see an image below for\nease) and enter the enrolment code: **PsychGold**\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000260.png)\n\n## **Support pages and other guides to get you started**\n\nThere is a fantastic set of resources available to new users\n\n<https://support.gorilla.sc/support/>\n\nWith a 'Getting Started Guide'\n<https://support.gorilla.sc/support/walkthrough/getting-started>\n\nAnd onboarding videos <https://support.gorilla.sc/support/getstarted>\n\n![](images/Screenshot - Microsoft Word-10-11-000262.png)\n\n**Gordon's Top Tip: Time spent preparing your materials really pays off\n-- in terms of time, data quality and confidence!**\n\nThis is an exciting point in term. You've critically evaluated research\nto inform your own approach to the topic. You've probably identified\nuseful measures and tasks to use in your studies. Now is the time to\nstart developing your studies for real.\n\nSome of your studies may comprise questionnaire measures and other\ndemographic or participant details. Some may involve more complex\nbehavioural tasks. Even in person studies might benefit from using\nQualtrics or a computerised task.\n\nBear in mind that you need to have completed building these BEFORE you\napply for ethics later this term. Once your materials are approved, they\ncan't be changed. Now is the time to make them as effective as possible\nin terms of the research question, but also as user-friendly as possible\n-- for you AND the participants. The quality of these materials will\ndirectly impact the quality of your data.\n\nThere will be some pragmatic decisions that you make, such as\nidentifying economical measures for variables of interest. A study that\nis too time-consuming will be unattractive and you are required to\nestimate how long a study takes to complete to participants before they\ntake part. Always consider the user experience. There is no requirement\nthat your study is long and complicated. This is a modest first research\nstudy. There is no benefit to long and complicated!\n\nAnd you should consider how user-friendly your materials are for\nparticipants and experimenter alike. Try to make the materials you\nemploy appear professional and attractive. You will be submitting your\nmaterials and they will be appraised for professionalism and\npresentation. But thinking of yourself next term, the easier it is to\noutput your data and begin your analysis, the better.\n\nTake the time to label your questions clearly and verify the data\noutputs in an intelligible format. We will cover this in later labs, but\nwhy not poke around in advance and ensure it's a smooth process! Take\nthe time to recode variables into output that you can use easily. And\nuse 'Scoring' to give you automatically produced means, totals and\nsubscales wherever possible. It will save you time and worry in Term 2!\n\nSimply put; being as confident in your materials as possible will save\nyou time and increase your confidence in the New Year (and Next Year!)\n\n**Looking forward to Third Year: Data collection and management as\nvaluable skills**\n\nYou might think that something like Qualtrics isn't a hugely valuable\nskill to learn. Well, in a high proportion of cases you'll use it next\nyear for your Final Year Dissertation, and being confident doing that is\nworthwhile in itself.\n\nBut you'd be amazed how common it is nowadays to want to survey opinion\nor attitudes. Imagine you are running a business and want to find out\nwhat your customers think about your product. Imagine you are managing\nan organization and need to understand how much time your employees\nspend on unnecessarily difficult tasks, or how they rate you as a boss.\n\nAsking questions using surveys is a quick way to generate important\ninsights, but not as easy as people think. Being able to design good\nquestions, and delivering them well, is a valuable skill.\n\nAnd once you have lots of lovely data, being able to manage those data\nwell enough to allow you to extract the important insights hiding within\nis something that very few people are able to do well... You'll be\nexpert at such things.\n\nI've already mentioned that Excel (or Numbers or Google Sheets) are\nincredibly common tools you'll probably use on a regular basis in your\nfuture lives. Contact lists, customer databases, financial results and\naccounts, stock inventories, meta-data, Gannt charts and the list goes\non. We are training you in important skills here!\n\nBeing confident manipulating and presenting data -- Data Literacy - is\nsomething you will likely wish to highlight on future CVs and you can\nbegin to develop those skills in your Mini-Dissertation, and refine and\nperfect them next year. Being confident with data will allow you to\nthink bigger about your Final Year Dissertation than if you are worried\nabout this.\n\nMany of you will be anxious about 'statistics'. I'd hope, in due course,\nthat your experience this year will help to allay those fears. But I\nbelieve the biggest anxiety students experience around 'statistics'\nisn't the statistics part of it at all. I believe that moving from raw\ndata to an analysis-ready dataset is the intimidating bit, not the few\nbutton presses in SPSS. For this reason, we have oodles of support in\nTerm 2 around how to prepare, clean, and screen your data, so that you\ncan unleash all the SPSS skills you've been learning in Design &\nAnalysis with zero stress.\n\nHave a great week.\n"},"formats":{"pdf":{"identifier":{"display-name":"PDF","target-format":"pdf","base-format":"pdf"},"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","citeproc":true,"toc":false,"include-in-header":{"text":"\\usepackage{fancyhdr}\n\\pagestyle{fancy}\n\\fancyfoot[C]{\\thepage}\n\\renewcommand{\\headrulewidth}{0.4pt}\n\\renewcommand{\\footrulewidth}{0.4pt}\n"},"include-before-body":{"text":"\\raggedright\n"},"output-file":"worksheet.pdf"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
