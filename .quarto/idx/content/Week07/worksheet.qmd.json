Below are four terms commonly used in\nquantitative research which, in my opinion, are also highly applicable\nto numerous qualitative research methodologies (although likely not\nreferred to using the same terms):\n\n# Types of Validity in Research Assessment\n\n## Face Validity\n\nFace validity refers to the degree to which an assessment method appears\nto be effective in measuring a specific characteristic at first glance.\nThis form of validity is useful for gaining participant cooperation in\nresearch. However, it relies solely on subjective judgment and is not a\nreliable standalone indicator of an assessment's accuracy in measuring\nthe intended characteristic.\n\n## Content Validity\n\nContent validity measures how well an assessment tool or procedure\ncaptures the entire scope and depth of the characteristic being\nevaluated. It is particularly relevant when assessing achievements,\nusually through a set of specific questions or practical tasks. An\nassessment has high content validity if it adequately represents various\naspects of the content area and necessitates behaviors and skills\nessential to that area.\n\n## Criterion Validity\n\nCriterion validity assesses how well the outcomes of a strategy\ncorrelate with another related characteristic (the criterion). For\ninstance, a personality test for measuring shyness or extroversion\ndemonstrates criterion validity if it aligns with other measures of\nsociability. Similarly, a method for gauging a salesperson's\neffectiveness should correlate with actual sales made. When the\ncriterion is evaluated later in time, this form of validity is also\nknown as predictive validity.\n\n## Construct Validity\n\nConstruct validity pertains to the extent to which an assessment\nstrategy provides reliable results for a characteristic that is not\ndirectly observable but inferred from behavior or output patterns (known\nas a construct). Constructs like motivation, creativity, racial\nprejudice, and happiness cannot be directly observed. Hence, researchers\nmust gather evidence that their methods accurately assess these\nconstructs through behavior observation, questioning, task presentation,\nor evaluation of created products.\n\n# Strategies for Establishing and Enhancing the Validity of Assessment Tools\n\nIn research, it's essential to persuade fellow scholars of the validity\nof your assessment strategies for your specific objectives.\nOccasionally, this validation might already be established by prior\nstudies, allowing you to reference their work in your literature review\nor methods section. However, there are times when you need to\nindependently validate your assessment methods. Below are some methods\nresearchers commonly employ to substantiate the effectiveness of their\nchosen assessment strategies:\n\n1.  **Ensuring Comprehensive Representation**: When developing\n    structured assessments, whether paper-and-pencil, computer-based, or\n    performance-based, it's crucial to ensure that they encompass the\n    entire range and depth of the characteristic under study. This is\n    particularly important when content validity is the main focus. The\n    assessment tool should mirror the entire spectrum and complexity of\n    the domain or characteristic in question. For instance, educational\n    researchers aiming to develop an effective achievement test for a\n    specific content area might start by creating a table of\n    specifications. This table might list the specific topics and\n    behaviors (like factual knowledge, problem-solving skills, critical\n    thinking) indicative of achievement in that area. Each cell in the\n    grid denotes the importance of each topic-behavior combination,\n    guiding the development of questions or tasks in appropriate\n    proportions to each item on the list or catalogue.\n\n2.  **Adopting a Multitrait--Multimethod Approach**: This might be\n    beyond the scope of the mini-dissertation, but if you propose to\n    examine a concept in depth for your final year dissertation, this\n    approach is potentially merited. It involves assessing two or more\n    traits using multiple methods. It's the psychometric equivalent of\n    the old advice to measure twice and cut once (maybe?). Simply put,\n    different assessments of a single trait should correlate strongly,\n    while the same method used for different traits should not. For\n    instance, in studying high school students, a researcher might\n    evaluate constructs like academic and social motivation using both\n    self-report questionnaires and teacher observation checklists.\n    Statistical analyses should show high correlations between the\n    different measures of academic motivation and similarly for social\n    motivation. However, measures assessing different traits (e.g.,\n    academic versus social motivation) through the same method (e.g.,\n    self-report questionnaires) should not demonstrate a high\n    correlation, nor should this be the case with different methods\n    assessing the same trait.\n\n3.  **Alignment with a Conceptual Framework**: A conceptual framework,\n    or nomological network, is a network of interconnected concepts that\n    potentially explain a studied phenomenon. When your assessment\n    strategy, especially one focused on qualitative data that resists\n    complex statistical analysis, aligns with a specific conceptual\n    framework, it can significantly bolster its relevance and\n    effectiveness.\n\n4.  **Pilot Testing**: This is particularly relevant to the\n    mini-dissertation! Before fully implementing an assessment strategy,\n    particularly if it's not a pre-validated instrument, conducting\n    pilot tests with a smaller subset of your target group (people,\n    animals, artifacts, etc.) is crucial. This preliminary testing\n    allows you to identify and rectify any glaring or potential issues\n    in your strategy, enhancing its effectiveness and reliability.\n\n5.  **Expert Panel Review**: Sometimes referred to as the Delphi\n    Method - Involving a panel of experts to review and critique your\n    assessment tool or strategy is a practice even seasoned researchers\n    adopt. These experts, knowledgeable in the relevant field, for\n    example Clinicians in the case of a clinical application or\n    construct, provide valuable insights into the validity of the\n    assessment for measuring a specific characteristic. They can also\n    suggest improvements, such as additional criteria for checklists or\n    alternative questions and phrasings for interviews or\n    questionnaires. This step ensures that your assessment strategy is\n    thoroughly vetted and optimized for accuracy and relevance.\n\n# Forms of Reliability in Assessment Strategies\n\nReliability in assessment strategies manifests in various forms, each\nrelevant to different types of assessments. Here are four commonly used\nforms of Reliability:\n\n1.  **Interrater Reliability**: This is the degree to which multiple\n    evaluators agree in their judgments when assessing the same product\n    or performance.\n\n2.  **Test--Retest Reliability**: This measures the consistency of\n    results from a single assessment tool when applied to the same\n    individuals over a short period.\n\n3.  **Equivalent-Forms Reliability**: This refers to the consistency in\n    results when two different versions of the same assessment tool\n    (like two forms of a test) are used. Some people like to try\n    Split-half reliability, where you simply see if both halves of a\n    measure are equally accurate - or rather, give similar results.\n\n4.  **Internal Consistency Reliability**: This looks at how consistently\n    different items or tasks within a single assessment method yield\n    similar results.\n\n## Important Points About Reliability\n\n-   **Reliability as a Prerequisite for Validity**: An assessment\n    strategy can only be valid if it is also reliable. Accurate\n    assessment depends on consistent measurement, meaning enhancing\n    reliability can potentially increase validity.\n\n-   **Reliability Does Not Guarantee Accuracy**: While necessary,\n    reliability alone doesn't ensure the accuracy of an assessment. For\n    example, consistently measuring head circumference as an indicator\n    of intelligence might be reliable but lacks validity since head size\n    doesn't reflect intelligence.\n\n## Determining Reliability Mathematically\n\nTo determine reliability, numerical data is essential. For instance, in\nobservational research, the agreement percentage between two assistants\ncategorizing data can indicate reliability. A 95% agreement suggests\nhigh reliability, while a 50% rate is concerning. In certain\nquantitative research, more complex statistical analyses are used,\ninvolving correlation coefficients to measure the degree of similarity\nin assessment results. You might use this if your mini-dissertation\ninvolved behavioural coding or observation techniques.\n\n## Enhancing Reliability (and Indirectly Validity)\n\n1.  **Defining Clear Criteria**: Especially in assessments requiring\n    subjective judgment, defining specific criteria for categorizing or\n    rating is crucial. Concrete, illustrative examples can clarify\n    categories, such as different types of aggression in behavioral\n    studies. This might take the form of a code-book.\n\n2.  **Standardization in Structured Instruments**: Consistency in\n    content, format, and evaluation criteria is key. However,\n    adjustments may be needed for participants with disabilities to\n    ensure validity.\n\n3.  **Rater Training for Consistency**: When subjective judgments are\n    involved, training raters to apply criteria uniformly enhances both\n    reliability and validity. Revisions to the strategy for greater\n    rater consistency might also be necessary as part of the piloting\n    programme.\n\nRemember, this is all aiming to deliver the most accurate, and\nhigh-resolution data possible. I think it is intuitive to see this in\naction - a natural drive for precision, but this applies to online tools\nalso. Please pilot. Please verify your data are in a proper format when\nyou export it, or prepare to analyse it. Mistakes are not a problem this\nyear (within reason), but will be upsetting next year!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Ethics II & Reliability and Validity\n\nThis week has two major areas of focus - a deeper dive on the Ethics\nApplication Portal, including information that will be required, and to\nrecap Psychometric Reliability and Validity.\n\n## By the end of the session, you will have:\n\nThis week is focussed on the following overarching learning objectives\n\n::: callout\n-   Be fully prepared to submit a successful Ethics Application\n-   Understand and be able to critically assess the strengths and\n    limitations of psychological measures in terms of their reliability\n    and validity.\n:::\n\n## Two main parts of the lab this week\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"false\"}\n## Activities for this week\n\n-   [ ] Ethics Portal information deep dive\n-   [ ] Psychometric Reliability and Validity\n:::\n\n## Ethics II\n\nFamiliarise yourself with the important Ethics resources available on\nthe VLE.

Below are four terms commonly used in\nquantitative research which, in my opinion, are also highly applicable\nto numerous qualitative research methodologies (although likely not\nreferred to using the same terms):\n\n# Types of Validity in Research Assessment\n\n## Face Validity\n\nFace validity refers to the degree to which an assessment method appears\nto be effective in measuring a specific characteristic at first glance.\nThis form of validity is useful for gaining participant cooperation in\nresearch. However, it relies solely on subjective judgment and is not a\nreliable standalone indicator of an assessment's accuracy in measuring\nthe intended characteristic.\n\n## Content Validity\n\nContent validity measures how well an assessment tool or procedure\ncaptures the entire scope and depth of the characteristic being\nevaluated. It is particularly relevant when assessing achievements,\nusually through a set of specific questions or practical tasks. An\nassessment has high content validity if it adequately represents various\naspects of the content area and necessitates behaviors and skills\nessential to that area.\n\n## Criterion Validity\n\nCriterion validity assesses how well the outcomes of a strategy\ncorrelate with another related characteristic (the criterion). For\ninstance, a personality test for measuring shyness or extroversion\ndemonstrates criterion validity if it aligns with other measures of\nsociability. Similarly, a method for gauging a salesperson's\neffectiveness should correlate with actual sales made. When the\ncriterion is evaluated later in time, this form of validity is also\nknown as predictive validity.\n\n## Construct Validity\n\nConstruct validity pertains to the extent to which an assessment\nstrategy provides reliable results for a characteristic that is not\ndirectly observable but inferred from behavior or output patterns (known\nas a construct). Constructs like motivation, creativity, racial\nprejudice, and happiness cannot be directly observed. Hence, researchers\nmust gather evidence that their methods accurately assess these\nconstructs through behavior observation, questioning, task presentation,\nor evaluation of created products.\n\n# Strategies for Establishing and Enhancing the Validity of Assessment Tools\n\nIn research, it's essential to persuade fellow scholars of the validity\nof your assessment strategies for your specific objectives.\nOccasionally, this validation might already be established by prior\nstudies, allowing you to reference their work in your literature review\nor methods section. However, there are times when you need to\nindependently validate your assessment methods. Below are some methods\nresearchers commonly employ to substantiate the effectiveness of their\nchosen assessment strategies:\n\n1.  **Ensuring Comprehensive Representation**: When developing\n    structured assessments, whether paper-and-pencil, computer-based, or\n    performance-based, it's crucial to ensure that they encompass the\n    entire range and depth of the characteristic under study. This is\n    particularly important when content validity is the main focus. The\n    assessment tool should mirror the entire spectrum and complexity of\n    the domain or characteristic in question. For instance, educational\n    researchers aiming to develop an effective achievement test for a\n    specific content area might start by creating a table of\n    specifications. This table might list the specific topics and\n    behaviors (like factual knowledge, problem-solving skills, critical\n    thinking) indicative of achievement in that area. Each cell in the\n    grid denotes the importance of each topic-behavior combination,\n    guiding the development of questions or tasks in appropriate\n    proportions to each item on the list or catalogue.\n\n2.  **Adopting a Multitrait--Multimethod Approach**: This might be\n    beyond the scope of the mini-dissertation, but if you propose to\n    examine a concept in depth for your final year dissertation, this\n    approach is potentially merited. It involves assessing two or more\n    traits using multiple methods. It's the psychometric equivalent of\n    the old advice to measure twice and cut once (maybe?). Simply put,\n    different assessments of a single trait should correlate strongly,\n    while the same method used for different traits should not. For\n    instance, in studying high school students, a researcher might\n    evaluate constructs like academic and social motivation using both\n    self-report questionnaires and teacher observation checklists.\n    Statistical analyses should show high correlations between the\n    different measures of academic motivation and similarly for social\n    motivation. However, measures assessing different traits (e.g.,\n    academic versus social motivation) through the same method (e.g.,\n    self-report questionnaires) should not demonstrate a high\n    correlation, nor should this be the case with different methods\n    assessing the same trait.\n\n3.  **Alignment with a Conceptual Framework**: A conceptual framework,\n    or nomological network, is a network of interconnected concepts that\n    potentially explain a studied phenomenon. When your assessment\n    strategy, especially one focused on qualitative data that resists\n    complex statistical analysis, aligns with a specific conceptual\n    framework, it can significantly bolster its relevance and\n    effectiveness.\n\n4.  **Pilot Testing**: This is particularly relevant to the\n    mini-dissertation! Before fully implementing an assessment strategy,\n    particularly if it's not a pre-validated instrument, conducting\n    pilot tests with a smaller subset of your target group (people,\n    animals, artifacts, etc.) is crucial. This preliminary testing\n    allows you to identify and rectify any glaring or potential issues\n    in your strategy, enhancing its effectiveness and reliability.\n\n5.  **Expert Panel Review**: Sometimes referred to as the Delphi\n    Method - Involving a panel of experts to review and critique your\n    assessment tool or strategy is a practice even seasoned researchers\n    adopt. These experts, knowledgeable in the relevant field, for\n    example Clinicians in the case of a clinical application or\n    construct, provide valuable insights into the validity of the\n    assessment for measuring a specific characteristic. They can also\n    suggest improvements, such as additional criteria for checklists or\n    alternative questions and phrasings for interviews or\n    questionnaires. This step ensures that your assessment strategy is\n    thoroughly vetted and optimized for accuracy and relevance.\n\n# Forms of Reliability in Assessment Strategies\n\nReliability in assessment strategies manifests in various forms, each\nrelevant to different types of assessments. Here are four commonly used\nforms of Reliability:\n\n1.  **Interrater Reliability**: This is the degree to which multiple\n    evaluators agree in their judgments when assessing the same product\n    or performance.\n\n2.  **Test--Retest Reliability**: This measures the consistency of\n    results from a single assessment tool when applied to the same\n    individuals over a short period.\n\n3.  **Equivalent-Forms Reliability**: This refers to the consistency in\n    results when two different versions of the same assessment tool\n    (like two forms of a test) are used. Some people like to try\n    Split-half reliability, where you simply see if both halves of a\n    measure are equally accurate - or rather, give similar results.\n\n4.  **Internal Consistency Reliability**: This looks at how consistently\n    different items or tasks within a single assessment method yield\n    similar results.\n\n## Important Points About Reliability\n\n-   **Reliability as a Prerequisite for Validity**: An assessment\n    strategy can only be valid if it is also reliable. Accurate\n    assessment depends on consistent measurement, meaning enhancing\n    reliability can potentially increase validity.\n\n-   **Reliability Does Not Guarantee Accuracy**: While necessary,\n    reliability alone doesn't ensure the accuracy of an assessment. For\n    example, consistently measuring head circumference as an indicator\n    of intelligence might be reliable but lacks validity since head size\n    doesn't reflect intelligence.\n\n## Determining Reliability Mathematically\n\nTo determine reliability, numerical data is essential. For instance, in\nobservational research, the agreement percentage between two assistants\ncategorizing data can indicate reliability. A 95% agreement suggests\nhigh reliability, while a 50% rate is concerning. In certain\nquantitative research, more complex statistical analyses are used,\ninvolving correlation coefficients to measure the degree of similarity\nin assessment results. You might use this if your mini-dissertation\ninvolved behavioural coding or observation techniques.\n\n## Enhancing Reliability (and Indirectly Validity)\n\n1.  **Defining Clear Criteria**: Especially in assessments requiring\n    subjective judgment, defining specific criteria for categorizing or\n    rating is crucial. Concrete, illustrative examples can clarify\n    categories, such as different types of aggression in behavioral\n    studies. This might take the form of a code-book.\n\n2.  **Standardization in Structured Instruments**: Consistency in\n    content, format, and evaluation criteria is key. However,\n    adjustments may be needed for participants with disabilities to\n    ensure validity.\n\n3.  **Rater Training for Consistency**: When subjective judgments are\n    involved, training raters to apply criteria uniformly enhances both\n    reliability and validity. Revisions to the strategy for greater\n    rater consistency might also be necessary as part of the piloting\n    programme.\n\nRemember, this is all aiming to deliver the most accurate, and\nhigh-resolution data possible. I think it is intuitive to see this in\naction - a natural drive for precision, but this applies to online tools\nalso. Please pilot. Please verify your data are in a proper format when\nyou export it, or prepare to analyse it. Mistakes are not a problem this\nyear (within reason), but will be upsetting next year!\n"},"formats":{"pdf":{"identifier":{"display-name":"PDF","target-format":"pdf","base-format":"pdf"},"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","citeproc":true,"toc":false,"include-in-header":{"text":"\\usepackage{fancyhdr}\n\\pagestyle{fancy}\n\\fancyfoot[C]{\\thepage}\n\\renewcommand{\\headrulewidth}{0.4pt}\n\\renewcommand{\\footrulewidth}{0.4pt}\n"},"include-before-body":{"text":"\\raggedright\n"},"output-file":"worksheet.pdf"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
