Properties of Psychometric tests\n\nProperties of psychometric tests\n\nTwo important properties of psychometric tests\n\n[Reliability]{.underline}\n\n--The consistency with which a test measures the construct\n\n[Validity]{.underline}\n\n--The degree to which a test actually measures what it claims to measure\n\"accuracy\"\n\n## Essential properties: Validity\n\nA test is valid if it assesses what it claims to measure\n\nThe validity of an assessment strategy is the extent to which the\nstrategy yields a reasonably accurate estimation of the characteristic\nor phenomenon in question.\n\nMany steps to achieve validity (including concurrent validity,\npredictive validity, construct validity and face validity)\n\n## Essential properties: Reliability\n\nTest retest reliability\n\n-- Rule of thumb r between the two test times , 3 months apart \\> 0.7\n(just under 50% agreement)\n\n-- Test re-test reliability is not perfect -- never reaches 1: beware\nreal changes!\n\nInternal consistency reliability\n\n-- Internal consistency is the degree to which all items are measuring\nthe same construct\n\n-- Cronbach's Alpha should be greater than .70 for scales with items \\>\n10\n\n## Reliability and Validity\n\nI like to think of them as Consistency and Accuracy\n\n![](images/paste-5BFB3ED5.png)\n\n## Different types of tests - raters\n\nBehavioral

Standardizing psychometric test scores\n\nThe raw score on many psychometric tests is based on an arbitrary scale\n\nTo give the scores meaning, we compare a person's scores to a
