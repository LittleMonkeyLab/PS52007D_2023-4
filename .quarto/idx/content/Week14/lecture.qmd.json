Develop skills in ethnography, narrative analysis,\n    and discourse analysis to bring fresh perspectives to clinical\n    psychology.\n\n-   **Methodological Innovation**: Foster a creative approach to\n    research methods.

Understand how your\n    work can contribute to societal change and uphold ethical standards\n    in research.\n\n-   **Reflexivity and Critical Thinking**: Practice reflexivity in your\n    work. Be critical of your biases and assumptions, and understand how\n    they influence your research and clinical practice.\n\n-   **Advocacy and Empowerment**: Position yourself as an advocate for\n    marginalized communities. Use your skills to empower individuals and\n    groups, contributing to social justice through clinical psychology.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Crafting a Standout Identity and Personal Statement\n\n-   **Professional Presence**: Join Linkedin, attend seminars or\n    conferences, advertise your research skills/interest, join volunteer\n    organisations\n\n-   **Tailored CVs**: Customize your CV for each application. Highlight\n    relevant coursework, projects, and research experiences that align\n    with clinical psychology.\n\n-   **Impactful Personal Statements**: Convey your passion for\n    psychology and your commitment to pursuing a career in clinical\n    psychology.
