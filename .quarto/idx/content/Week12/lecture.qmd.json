days to months.\n    -   Diaries can be structured with specific prompts or unstructured,\n        allowing free expression.\n-   **Applications in Psychology**:\n    -   Useful for studying patterns in behavior, mood, social\n        interactions, and psychological states.\n    -   Provides a longitudinal perspective, capturing changes and\n        developments over time.\n\n## Diary Studies in Qualitative Research 2\n\n-   **Advantages**:\n    -   Captures data in participants' natural environments, leading to\n        high ecological validity.\n    -   Offers a deeper understanding of subjective experiences and\n        daily life contexts.\n    -   Enables the study of phenomena as they occur, reducing recall\n        bias.\n-   **Challenges**:\n    -   Relies on participant commitment and honesty in regular entries.\n    -   Data can be voluminous and varied, requiring careful and\n        sensitive analysis.\n    -   Potential issues with privacy and ensuring confidentiality of\n        personal records.\n-   **Tips**:\n    -   Engage the participant with the study's purpose and diary\n        guidelines to participants.\n    -   Attrition is HUGE.\n    -   Be prepared for a detailed and nuanced analysis of the diary\n        entries (qual AND quant).\n    -   Consider alternatives such as **Experience Sampling**, or **Day\n        Reconstruction**
