Open research ensures that the data and\n    methodologies used are accessible to others, facilitating a deeper\n    understanding of what was done and verification of research\n    findings.\n\n2.  **Building Trust in Scientific Findings**: Transparent practices in\n    research foster trust among the scientific community, policymakers,\n    and the public. When researchers openly share their methods and\n    data, it demonstrates a commitment to honesty and integrity in their\n    work.\n\n3.  **Promoting Collaboration and Innovation**: Open research encourages\n    collaborative efforts, as it allows researchers from different\n    fields and geographies to access, utilize, and build upon existing\n    knowledge. This cross-pollination of ideas can lead to innovative\n    solutions and advancements.\n\n4.  **Accelerating Scientific Discovery**: By making research findings\n    and data openly available, the pace of scientific discovery can be\n    quickened. Researchers can leverage existing work to explore new\n    avenues of inquiry without duplicating efforts.\n\n5.  **Advancing Educational Opportunities**: Open research provides\n    valuable resources for education and training (maybe you benefited\n    from access to Open Resources while developing your\n    Mini-Dissertation?), allowing students and early-career researchers\n    to access a wealth of information and learn from real-world data and\n    methodologies.\n\n### **Role of Open Materials**\n\n1.  **Facilitating Research Transparency**: Open materials, which\n    include datasets, software, protocols, and other research tools, are\n    central to ensuring transparency. They allow others to understand,\n    evaluate, and replicate the research process.\n\n2.  **Standardizing Research Practices**: Open materials can help in\n    standardizing procedures across studies, leading to more consistent\n    and reliable research outcomes.\n\n### **What Open Materials Need to Achieve**\n\n1.  **Comprehensiveness**: They should provide a complete picture of the\n    research process you employed, including informed consent and\n    information information, tools used, and detailed methodological\n    information.\n\n2.  **Accessibility**: Materials should be easily accessible to\n    researchers from various fields, irrespective of their resources.\n    Don't share files that can't be viewed by anyone, such as\n    pay-for-software etc. It's not such a huge deal for the\n    Mini-Dissertation, but in reality, it's counter to the point if you\n    share, say, an SPSS file.\n\n3.  **Usability**: Open materials should be user-friendly, with clear\n    documentation and instructions to enable effective utilization by\n    others. They are designed to facilitate, not complicate!\n\n4.  **Interoperability**: Compatibility with different platforms and\n    software is crucial to ensure that a wide range of researchers can\n    use these materials. Similar to 2, but distinct.\n\n5.  **Longevity**: Ensuring that open materials are preserved for\n    long-term use and remain accessible as technologies evolve. Again,\n    not a big deal with a coursework submission, as they will NOT be\n    published by me, but if you publish your Final Year Dissertation,\n    you would want it to be long-lived!\n\nBy adhering to these principles of Openness and Collaborativeness, the\nscientific community can significantly benefit from open research\npractices, leading to more robust, innovative, and transparent\nscientific inquiry. And less frustration/guess-work when you come to\nreplicate or extend work!\n\n## Tips\n\nYour open materials are obviously going to be specific to your own\nresearch study. They obviously need to fully illustrate the wonderful\nthings that you've created in the course of your mini-dissertation.\n\nFor the purposes of the mini-dissertation, you can take one of two\napproaches. You can either be extremely selfish and solely present the\nmaterials and tools that you used to generate the data for your\nindividual 2x2 ANOVA, or you could view it as a mark-winning opportunity\nto demonstrate the wide-ranging gorgeousness of all the things that you\nand your group submitted.\n\nFor the purposes of the marking, the open materials is not a right or\nwrong exercise. Make the decision of what to include yourself. But do\npay attention to what a Researcher such as myself would need to fully\nunderstand your task and to be able to replicate it. It's fine if I\ncan't fully replicate something that belongs to somebody else, but I\nneed to be able to replicate what you produced.\n\nAnd do pay attention to what goes in open materials and what goes in\nopen data. It is common that people have trouble working out where a\nquestionnaire and its associated data might go.\n\nI want to be able to test people with the right questionnaire measure\nand I would want to find the 'questionnaire' in Open Materials. But of\ncourse, the questionnaire results will appear in open data, where a\ncodebook might be useful. But we'll cover that next week.\n\n## Some examples to get ideas from\n\n### Information sheets/consent (not the easiest to read, but useful)\n\n![](images/OM2@2x.png)\n\n### Debrief form\n\n![](images/OMdebrief@2x.png)\n\n### Redacted Ethics and Approval\n\n![](images/RedactEthicsApproval@2x.png)\n\n### Stimulus items\n\n![](images/OM1@2x.png)\n\n### Video Stimulus Items (the link REALLY helps!)\n\n![](images/OM8@2x.png)\n\n### A good illustration of a behaviour measure in Qualtrics\n\n![](images/OM7@2x.png)\n\n### Comprehensive Questionnaire description with notes\n\n![](images/OM3@2x.png)\n\n### If you still have a live link, or categorised continuous IVs\n\nn.b.
