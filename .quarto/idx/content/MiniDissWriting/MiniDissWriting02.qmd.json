The Method section is not\njust a procedural description but a showcase of your meticulous planning\nand execution of research, adhering to the principles of Open Science by\nalso attaching an Open Materials submission (to be covered later in\ndetail).\n\n## Method {.unnumbered}\n\nThe method section is where you describe how you conducted your study.\nAn important principle for writing a method section is that it should be\nclear and detailed enough that other researchers could replicate the\nstudy by following your \"recipe.\" This means that it must describe all\nthe important elements of the study---basic demographic characteristics\nof the participants, how they were recruited, whether they were randomly\nassigned, how the variables were manipulated or measured, how\ncounterbalancing was accomplished, and so on. At the same time, it\nshould avoid irrelevant details such as the fact that the study was\nconducted in Classroom 37B of the Industrial Technology Building or that\nthe questionnaire was double-sided and completed using mechanical\npencils.\n\nThe method section begins immediately after the introduction ends with\nthe heading \"Method\" (not \"Methods\" - I'm always making that mistake!)\ncentered on the page. Immediately after this is the subheading\n\"Participants,\" left justified and in italics. The participants\nsubsection indicates how many participants there were, the number of\nmale, female and other/prefer not to say (or any response options you\noffered), some indication of their age, other demographics that may be\nrelevant to the study, and how they were recruited, including any\nincentives given for participation.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## APA Style and the Values of Psychology\n\nRobert Madigan and his colleagues have argued that APA style has a\npurpose that often goes unrecognized [@madigan1995language].\nSpecifically, it promotes psychologists' scientific values and\nassumptions. From this perspective, many features of APA style that at\nfirst seem arbitrary actually make good sense. Following are several\nfeatures of APA-style writing and the scientific values or assumptions\nthey reflect.\n\n```{r values, echo = FALSE, }\nfeature <- c(\"There are very few direct quotations of other researchers.\",\n             \"\",\n             \"Criticisms are directed at other researchers’ work but not at them personally.\",\n             \"\",\n             \"There are many references and reference citations.\",\"\",\"Empirical research reports are organized with specific sections in a fixed order.\",\n             \"\",\n             \"Researchers tend to “hedge” their conclusions, e.g., “The results suggest that…”\")\nvalue <- c(\"The phenomena and theories of psychology are objective and do not depend on the specific words a particular researcher used to describe them.\",\n           \"\",\n           \"The focus of scientific research is on drawing general conclusions about the world, not on the personalities of particular researchers.\",\n           \"\",\n           \"Scientific research is a large-scale collaboration among many researchers.\",\n           \"\",\n           \"There is an ideal approach to conducting empirical research in psychology (even if this ideal is not always achieved in actual research).\",\n           \"\",\n           \"Scientific knowledge is tentative and always subject to revision based on new empirical results.\")\nvalues <- data.frame(feature,value)\n\nknitr::kable(values,\n  col.name=c(\"APA style feature\",\"Scientific value or assumption\"))\n```\n:::\n\n### Purpose of the Method Section\n\n-   The Method section is crucial for allowing others to replicate your\n    study, ensuring the reliability and validity of your research\n    findings.\n-   A well-documented Method section demonstrates your thorough\n    understanding of research methodologies, earning you credibility and\n    potentially higher marks.\n\n### Overview of APA 7 Formatting\n\n-   APA7 emphasizes clarity, precision, and a bias-free language in\n    research writing. The simple way of understanding if a Method\n    section is complete and effective is to ask yourself, \"Could Gordon\n    take my Method section (and Open Materials) and replicate my study\n    perfectly?\". Don't include obvious information, such as the colour\n    of ink in pens or stuff I could figure out. Just the important\n    information!\n-   Consistency in formatting, such as headings, font, and citation\n    style (APA7), is key. If you are unclear on the appropriate format,\n    either use the template Gordon has provided, or refer to\n    apastyle.org for numerous examples.\n-   Use past tense to describe the methods used: \"Participants were\n    asked...\", \"The study used...\". You have completed the study after\n    all.\n\nA previous edition of the *Publication Manual* strongly discouraged the\nuse of the term *subjects* (except for nonhumans) and strongly\nencouraged the use of *participants* instead. But it also encourages the\nuse of more specific terms when possible: *college students*,\n*children*, *respondents*, and so on. If in doubt, refer to\nPARTICIPANTS!\n\nTable 2 (below) contains some of the most common types of APA style\nerrors based on an analysis of manuscripts submitted to one professional\njournal over a 6-year period \\[@onwuegbuzie2010evidence\\]. These errors\nwere committed by professional researchers but are probably similar to\nthose that students commit the most too. See also Note \"[O]\" in this\nsection and, of course, the *Publication Manual* itself.\n\n```{r errors, echo = FALSE, }\nerror <- c(\"1. Use of numbers\",\"2. Hyphenation\",\"3. Use of et al.\",\"4.

However, there are also many good websites on APA style, which\ndo an excellent job of presenting the basics for beginning researchers.\nHere are two of them.\n\nAPA Style: <http://www.apastyle.apa.org>\n\nPurdue Online Writing Lab:\n<https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html>\n:::\n\n## Participants\n\nIn this section, describe who participated in your study, how they were\nselected or recruited, and any demographic information relevant to your\nresearch question. If you used a nice poster, that would look great in\nyour Open Materials submission.\n\nBegin by reporting sample characteristics, sampling procedures, and\nsample size. Include demographic characteristics and be precise to aid\nestimation of generalizability. Use bias-free language and specify any\nincentives for participation.\n\nPlease be clear if you took advantage of any research participation\nschemes or synthetic or fabricated data provided by Gordon.\n\n### Sample Description\n\n-   Provide details like age, gender, ethnicity, or other relevant\n    characteristics.\n-   Example: \"The study comprised 100 undergraduate students (50%\n    female, 50% male), aged 18-25, from a South London University.\"\n-   You may also wish to include how many participants were excluded for\n    missing data (if any).\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\n-   Explain how participants gave informed consent and how you protected\n    their privacy. You will be able to demonstrate anonymisation of the\n    data in the Open Data (to be covered later!)\n-   Mention the ethical approval received from the Goldsmiths Ethics\n    Committee. Don't break anonymity by including an unredacted copy in\n    any supplementary materials!\n\n## Materials\n\nThis section covers the tools, questionnaires, or any equipment used in\nyour research. The goal is to describe the tools and techniques used for\nmeasuring ALL relevant variables. Include questionnaire or survey\nmeasures, and detail any instruments or task used, like hardware,\nsoftware, or tests. Don't repeat information, so if you Procedure\nsection includes the correct step by step information on. say, a task,\nrefer to it by name here maybe, and detail it in the procedure. Or if\nyou think there is value in detailing it here, just refer to it by name\nin the procedure section.\n\n### Instruments and Reliability\n\n-   Describe each tool used and its purpose in your research.\n-   Discuss the reliability and validity of these tools. It might be\n    worth looking back to your introduction to see if it is worth\n    including any findings associated with the tests you have used. Most\n    people don't cover the merits of the choice of measurement tools\n    when reviewing previous research.\n-   Example: \"The Big Five Personality Test (reference in APA format),\n    with a Cronbach's alpha of .82, was used to assess \\[x, y\\]\n    personality traits\"\n\n### Open Materials\n\n-   Briefly note that detailed discussion on Open Materials is covered\n    in a different section, but highlight their importance in enhancing\n    replicability and transparency of research.\n-   Example: \"Details on the questionnaires used, including their full\n    text, are provided in the Open Materials section.\"\n\n## Procedure\n\nDetail every step taken in your research, especially how you implemented\nthe 2x2 ANOVA, to allow for replication.\n\n### Detailed Description\n\n-   Start from the initial setup and move through to the data collection\n    phase.\n-   For a 2x2 ANOVA, specify the factors (independent variables) and\n    their levels.\n-   Example: \"Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups\n    (2x2 design: Factor A \\[Level one, Level two\\], Factor B \\[Level\n    one, Level two\\]). The response time was measured following the\n    presentation of stimuli.\"\n\n### Pilot Studies\n\n-   If applicable, describe any pilot study and its influence on the\n    main study.\n-   Example: \"A pilot study with four classmates was conducted to test\n    the feasibility of the experimental design. Based on the pilot\n    results, minor adjustments were made to ensure the clarity of\n    instructions given to participants (see Open Materials for\n    instruction sheet).\"\n\n## Design\n\nExplain the research design and clarify the variables involved in your\nstudy.\n\nYou have 2 IVs and a single continuous DV. It is important to present\nhow your IVs were categorised, so if you used a median split to turn a\ncontinuous measure into a categorical IV - make that clear here.\n\n### Research Design\n\n-   Emphasize that your study is quantitative and primarily uses a 2x2\n    ANOVA design.\n-   You will have used a between-groups design, a repeated-measures\n    design or a mixed design, make this clear, and if mixed, which IV is\n    which!\n-   It can be a good idea to explain why this design was chosen for your\n    research question.\n\n### Variables\n\n-   Define your independent variables (the two factors in your ANOVA -\n    each with 2 levels) and your dependent variable (what you measured).\n-   Example: \"The independent variables were age group (young, old using\n    a median split on Age \\[median 25 yrs\\]) and treatment type\n    (treatment, control). The dependent variable was memory recall\n    accuracy (percentage correct).\"\n\n## Keeping design and procedure separate!\n\nWhat is the difference between design and procedure?\n\n-   The design of a study is its overall structure.\n-   What were the independent and dependent variables?\n-   Was the independent variable manipulated, and if so, was it\n    manipulated between or within subjects?\n-   How were the variables operationally defined?\n\nThe procedure is how the study was carried out.\n\n-   It often works well to describe the procedure in terms of what the\n    participants did rather than what the researchers did.\n-   For example, the participants gave their informed consent, read a\n    set of instructions, completed a block of four practice trials,\n    completed a block of 12 test trials[^1], completed two\n    questionnaires, and were debriefed and excused.\n\n[^1]: Note four and 12 above. See APA Style - One to nine are spelled\n    out, 10 + can be written as digits!\n\n## Data Preparation (optional section if merited)\n\nIf you had any complex preprocessing steps, of which you were proud,\nsuch as 'coding' of responses, or calculating Implicit measures or\nStroop results, discuss how you processed that. .\n\n### Statistical Analysis will be covered in the Results section\n\n-   This will comprise Descriptive Stats, Inferential stats (including\n    Assumptions tests and post-hoc tests), as well as tables and\n    figures. You do not need to include any of these things in the\n    method section.\n\n### Open Materials and Open Data (to be covered later)\n\n-   Mention that Open Materials and Open Data will be included and so\n    can be referred to. Let the reader know that they are available,\n    like appendices.\n-   Example: \"The anonymised dataset generated from this study, along\n    with the Materials necessary to replicate the study, are available\n    in the Open Data & Open Materials supplements, ensuring transparency\n    and reproducibility of the findings.\"\n\n### Ethical Compliance\n\n-   Describe the process of obtaining ethical clearance and how you\n    adhered to ethical guidelines throughout the study.\n-   Example: \"Ethical clearance was obtained from the XYZ University\n    Ethics Committee, and all research activities were conducted in\n    accordance with appropriate Ethics committee and BPS guidance.\"\n\n## Writing Style and Formatting\n\nGuidelines for effectively communicating your methods in line with APA 7\nstandards.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tips for Writing\n\n-   **Use simple, understandable language** and explain specific terms.\n-   **Write in Active Voice.**\n-   Titles of subsections can be *italicized* and centered.\n-   Additional subsections, like \"Equipment,\" can be added if necessary.\n-   Ensure **information sources are credible**.\n-   Include only relevant information and omit details that don't affect\n    the experiment's replication.\n-   **Write in Past Tense.**\n-   Carefully **edit and proofread** to avoid errors.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n-   Overloading with unnecessary details that do not contribute to\n    replicability.\n\n-   Failing to use **bias-free language**.\n\n-   Not being precise in the description of materials and procedures,\n    including references or sources.\n\n-   Incorrect use of **APA formatting and style**, especially in\n    headings and subheadings.\n:::\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n### Method Section Awesomeness Checklist\n\n#### 1.

It is important to present\nhow your IVs were categorised, so if you used a median split to turn a\ncontinuous measure into a categorical IV - make that clear here.\n\n### Research Design\n\n-   Emphasize that your study is quantitative and primarily uses a 2x2\n    ANOVA design.\n-   You will have used a between-groups design, a repeated-measures\n    design or a mixed design, make this clear, and if mixed, which IV is\n    which!\n-   It can be a good idea to explain why this design was chosen for your\n    research question.\n\n### Variables\n\n-   Define your independent variables (the two factors in your ANOVA -\n    each with 2 levels) and your dependent variable (what you measured).\n-   Example: \"The independent variables were age group (young, old using\n    a median split on Age \\[median 25 yrs\\]) and treatment type\n    (treatment, control). The dependent variable was memory recall\n    accuracy (percentage correct).\"\n\n## Keeping design and procedure separate!\n\nWhat is the difference between design and procedure?\n\n-   The design of a study is its overall structure.\n-   What were the independent and dependent variables?\n-   Was the independent variable manipulated, and if so, was it\n    manipulated between or within subjects?\n-   How were the variables operationally defined?\n\nThe procedure is how the study was carried out.\n\n-   It often works well to describe the procedure in terms of what the\n    participants did rather than what the researchers did.\n-   For example, the participants gave their informed consent, read a\n    set of instructions, completed a block of four practice trials,\n    completed a block of 12 test trials[^1], completed two\n    questionnaires, and were debriefed and excused.\n\n[^1]: Note four and 12 above. See APA Style - One to nine are spelled\n    out, 10 + can be written as digits!\n\n## Data Preparation (optional section if merited)\n\nIf you had any complex preprocessing steps, of which you were proud,\nsuch as 'coding' of responses, or calculating Implicit measures or\nStroop results, discuss how you processed that. .\n\n### Statistical Analysis will be covered in the Results section\n\n-   This will comprise Descriptive Stats, Inferential stats (including\n    Assumptions tests and post-hoc tests), as well as tables and\n    figures. You do not need to include any of these things in the\n    method section.\n\n### Open Materials and Open Data (to be covered later)\n\n-   Mention that Open Materials and Open Data will be included and so\n    can be referred to. Let the reader know that they are available,\n    like appendices.\n-   Example: \"The anonymised dataset generated from this study, along\n    with the Materials necessary to replicate the study, are available\n    in the Open Data & Open Materials supplements, ensuring transparency\n    and reproducibility of the findings.\"\n\n### Ethical Compliance\n\n-   Describe the process of obtaining ethical clearance and how you\n    adhered to ethical guidelines throughout the study.\n-   Example: \"Ethical clearance was obtained from the XYZ University\n    Ethics Committee, and all research activities were conducted in\n    accordance with appropriate Ethics committee and BPS guidance.\"\n\n## Writing Style and Formatting\n\nGuidelines for effectively communicating your methods in line with APA 7\nstandards.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tips for Writing\n\n-   **Use simple, understandable language** and explain specific terms.\n-   **Write in Active Voice.**\n-   Titles of subsections can be *italicized* and centered.\n-   Additional subsections, like \"Equipment,\" can be added if necessary.\n-   Ensure **information sources are credible**.\n-   Include only relevant information and omit details that don't affect\n    the experiment's replication.\n-   **Write in Past Tense.**\n-   Carefully **edit and proofread** to avoid errors.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n-   Overloading with unnecessary details that do not contribute to\n    replicability.\n\n-   Failing to use **bias-free language**.\n\n-   Not being precise in the description of materials and procedures,\n    including references or sources.\n\n-   Incorrect use of **APA formatting and style**, especially in\n    headings and subheadings.\n:::\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n### Method Section Awesomeness Checklist\n\n#### 1.

So, if you email me about the course, don't be surprised if you get a brief 'Please post this to the Forum' message!   Office hours are advertised on the module VLE page."},"course":{"number":"PS52007D","semester":"Academic Year 2023-4","days":"Monday Lecture | Tuesday Labs","time":"10am","location":"PSH LG02","dates":"October to March, 2023-4","github":"https://www.github.com/littlemonkeylab/PS52007D_2023-4","url":"https://littlemonkeylab.com/PS52007D_2023-4","copyright_year":"2023"},"university":{"name":"Goldsmiths, University of London","url":"https://www.gold.ac.uk"},"school":{"name":"Department of Psychology","url":"https://gold.ac.uk/psychology"}},"comments":{"hypothesis":{"theme":"clean","openSidebar":false}},"theme":"simplex","mainfont":"Atkinson Hyperlegible","monofont":"Fira Code","linkcolor":"#BE3455","grid":{"sidebar-width":"250px","body-width":"900px","margin-width":"300px"},"editor":"visual","title":"Mini-Dissertation Write-up Guide","subtitle":"Part 02 - Method Section","author":[{"name":"Dr. Gordon Wright","orcid":"0000-0001-9424-5743","email":"g.wright@gold.ac.uk"}],"date":"01/15/2024","license":"CC BY-NC-SA"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}},"projectFormats":["html","pdf"]}
