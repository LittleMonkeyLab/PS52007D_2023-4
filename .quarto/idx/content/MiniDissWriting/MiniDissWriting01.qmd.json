Introduction\n\n-   **Summary**: Sets the stage for your research, introducing the\n    problem, research questions, and objectives. Your introduction\n    should finish with your hypotheses. Remember, you should have an\n    hypothesis for each main effect and potentially the interaction\n    effect too!\n-   **Advice**: Start with a general description, then move to\n    specifics. Synchronize your introduction with your conclusion to\n    ensure coherence and alignment with your findings.\n\n#### n.b.

It is\n    important to introduce any theoretical perspectives that exist.\n-   **Advice**: Focus on the most relevant studies and integrate them\n    into a cohesive narrative, sharing key information about the\n    studies, results, and methods. This chapter often accounts for a\n    significant portion of your dissertation.\n\n### 2. Method Section\n\n-   **Summary**: Describes the research design, participants, materials,\n    and procedures used in your study.\n-   **Advice**: Ensure clarity and detail for replicability.

And\n    you've put in such a great deal of effort... Show it off!!\n-   **Advice**: Use appendices for detailed tables, questionnaires, or\n    additional data that support your research.\n\n### 7. Reflective Account\n\n-   **Important**: This does not count towards your word count. If you\n    do not include this, your submission will be considered incomplete.\n    It can be a few sentences or a couple of paragraphs, but please make\n    it genuine.
