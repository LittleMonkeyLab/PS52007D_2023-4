In the field of psychology,\nsharing data is crucial for advancing scientific knowledge. This guide\nwill provide step-by-step instructions for creating an Open Data\nsubmission for a psychology research project such as the\nMini-Dissertation (and your Final Year Dissertations for that matter!).\n\n::: callout-important\n## Important\n\nIt is a compulsory that you submit your data. If you do not submit\nsomething, then your submission is not complete and the mark awarded\nwill be impacted.\n\nBy taking the time to produce a clear Open Data submission, you will\nenhance the overall quality of your submission, and this will be\nreflected in your mark.\n:::\n\n1.  Prepare your data: Before submitting your data, ensure that it is\n    well-organized, accurate, and complete. You might be fixated on\n    doing the analysis, but in many ways, the way you treat and\n    pre-process your data (prepare it for the analysis) is [even\n    more]{.underline} critical to reliable results.\n\n2.  This includes:\n\n    a\\. Cleaning and validating the data: Remove any errors,\n    inconsistencies, or missing values. This may be down to participant\n    error or a result of anything you might have done in this, your\n    first data collection exercise (mistakes are to be EXPECTED! Don't\n    hide them!). Make sure the data is properly formatted (an example\n    here might be consistent decimal places, or labelling in your\n    variable headers.\n\n    b\\. Anonymizing the data: To protect participants' privacy, remove\n    any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names,\n    addresses, or user generated codes. Replace these with unique\n    identifiers, if necessary. This can be as simple as a number from\n    1 - n (where n is your total sample size).\n\n3.  Create a data dictionary or codebook: A data dictionary is a simple\n    document that describes the variables in your dataset, their\n    definitions, units of measurement, and any coding schemes used, such\n    as values for any categorised data e.g. gender (1 = female, 2 =\n    male, 3 = prefer not to say).\n\n    This will help others understand and use your data more effectively.\n    Consider including the following information for each variable:\n\n    a.  Variable name as it exists in your dataset\n    b.  Variable description - what is the variable? Score on what\n        measure of your Open Materials?\n    c.  Data type (e.g., categorical, continuous, binary)\n    d.  Units of measurement (if applicable, milliseconds, hours per\n        day)\n    e.  Consider count information, or summary information (mean, range\n        etc)\n    f.  Coding scheme (if applicable, 1 = strongly disagree, 2 =\n        disagree etc.)\n\n4.  Information on any pre-processing you performed:\n\n    What were your decision rules on missing data or participant\n    exclusion? Your data set can be the original data set which includes\n    data you later do not analyse, or the data set that had undergone\n    pre-processing and had had all the missing values removed... in\n    either case, I want to know the process involved, so that I will be\n    able to do it if I try to replicate your analysis!\n\n5.  Choose a suitable format (or formats) for submission: In real\n    research, you could host this on OSF.io or a similar data\n    repository, but you are going to submit it as a supplementary file.\n    Choose a format (or formats) that are usable. Ideally, I would like\n    to be able to import your data directly, so it should be in a .csv,\n    .xlsx, or .sav file, but Jamovi, R or equivalent is fine too.\n\n    Any descriptive content (such as 3 or 4) could be in a pdf and\n    submitted alongside the Mini-Dissertation (you can submit up to 5\n    files)\n\nBy following these guidelines, you will contribute to a more transparent\nand collaborative research environment in the field of psychology,\nultimately promoting the advancement of scientific knowledge.\n\n\\raggedright\n\n## Week 14 - Getting set up to run your analysis\n\nGoals and outcomes of this week:\n\n-   A quick review of the SPSS Data editor window and some useful menu\n    options\n-   Inputting data into SPSS for your specific ANOVA design\n    -   [2x2 Independent (between-groups) ANOVA](#sec-2x2ind)\n    -   [2x2 Repeated measures ANOVA](#sec-2x2RM)\n    -   [2x2 Mixed ANOVA](#sec-2x2Mixed)\n-   Some useful calculations in SPSS\n    -   [Performing a Median Split in\n        SPSS](#sec-performing-a-median-split-in-spss)\n    -   [Calculating a mean score\n        variable](#sec-calculating-a-mean-score-variable)\n\n## Analysing your data starts here... with good set up! {#sec-analysing-your-data-starts-here...}\n\nI know that you have used SPSS plenty already, but it is normally the\ncase that you've only worked on downloaded pre-existing data sets, or\nfollowed step-by-step guides as a class. This time, these are YOUR data,\nof which you should be proud! Nobody has ever seen these data before.\n\n[Examples of the 3 flavours of dataset can be found on the\nVLE.](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1448200)\n\nFor your Mini-Dissertations you are going through all the stages of a\nresearch project, from idea origination, through to the final\npresentation of the report. One of the parts that often (unnecessarily)\ncauses anxiety is the analysis. Don't let it! You'll get lots of help in\nthe labs after Reading Week!\n\nIt is important that you go about the process of data preparation and\nanalysis methodically and with care. You've worked hard to generate\nthese data, give them the attention they deserve. And at the end of the\nprocess... you get to see what happened in your experiment.\n\nThis worksheet will offer you tools to start off well. I don't doubt\nthat you will have an occasional mishap, but that is how we learn and\nimprove. And I still google things sometimes!\n\nRemember, the mini-dissertation is carefully constrained to a 2x2\ndesign, but by using this as a case-study, we can equip you with all the\nskills necessary for something more exotic next year.\n\nWhen you open SPSS, you'll see the familiar Data Editor screen. Let me\npoint a few things out.\n\n![](images/image-416753022.png){width=\"300\"}\n\n![](images/image-1643419274.png) Open data document. This is where you\ncan navigate to open your data set. Obvious, I know.\n\n![](images/image-1272547429.png) This button saves your data set. Use\nthis regularly. And save your data set in the cloud. You do not want to\nhave to redo data preparation. And use version control. If you spend\ntime on a data set and reach the end of a session, save it with the date\nand start the next session with a copy. I dearly hope you listen to\nthis, and don't learn the hard way.\n\n![](images/image-1667930257.png) Recently used dialogues. Allows you to\npick from a dropdown menu of operations you have performed previously.\nMost people don't get to know this button exists and spend hours\nclicking through the menus. Using this button is the easiest way to do\nwhat you did last time, but make a slight modification (e.g. you forgot\nto select something).\n\n![](images/image-241978957.png) Most things that you do in the data\neditor window can be undone and redone. Anything that can't be undone\nwill give you a warning window. If you are going to try stuff out, use a\ncopy of your dataset and keep a safe copy of the last one you were\nworking on -- see Save button above.\n\n![](images/image-480798691.png) Flip between Value labels. You'll see\nhow this can be helpful later on. Just pointing it out for now.\n\n![](images/image-1370272646.png){width=\"150\"} Sometimes you want to look\nat your data (the numbers) and sometimes you want to look at what the\ndata are (labels and types of variables). `Data View` lets you look at\nthe numbers. Variable View lets you look at the labels and types of\nvariables in your data. Let's look at Variable View now.\n\nNow that you are reminded of those, let's get things ready for when your\ndata are ready.\n\n## Data input {#sec-data-input}\n\nIt may seem supremely dull, but properly formatting and labelling your\ndata is important. Remember that you will be uploading a dataset as part\nof your submission under Open Data. It is important that an outsider can\nunderstand your dataset and use it to reproduce your analysis, should\nthey wish.\n\n![](images/image-128904341.png){width=\"150\" height=\"20\"} We use the\n**`Variable View`** in SPSS to add and define the variables used in our\nstudy. Each row represents one of your variables. Here, we can give them\nsensible names and specify the type of data we are entering for each\none.\n\nSo start by thinking about **`Name`.** A variable name should be easy to\nunderstand and informative. You can't use spaces or symbols, so you\nshould think about using underscores or hyphens\nto-make-things_easier_to_understand.\n\n**`Type`** specifies the type of data that is contained in that\nvariable.\n\nWhen inputting your data, you will likely mostly use **`Numeric`,**\nwhich simply means it mostly numbers. It could be scores on a test, or\ncategories which might be relevant for gender or group membership\n(`1=Female, 2= Male, 3= Prefer not to say`, etc)\n\n![](images/image-1770594430.png)\n\n**`Width`** refers to the maximum number of characters in a given\nvariable. I don't think I've ever changed this from 8.\n\n**`Decimals`** allows you to specify if a value shows decimal places or\nnot. I've used 0 in some screengrabs below, so that decimal places are\nnot shown, and 2 decimal places in others. I would suggest sticking with\nthe default of 2, unless you are using very precise measurements.\n\n**`Label`** is VERY handy. It doesn't have the restrictions of `Name`,\nand so you can give a variable a really clear informative label. And it\nshows up in the output, meaning that the output is more easily\nunderstood. Do take the time to use this field, as once you step away\nfrom a dataset for even a couple of hours, it's possible to forget what\na variable is or represents.\n\n![](images/image-1725533457.png)\n\n`Value` is particularly useful for categorical variables (or nominal,\nnamed variables as SPSS prefers). Assign every group a name and SPSS\nwill attach that name to the output too. It's easier to compare output\nwith the labels 'Females' and 'Males' than '1' and '2'.\n\n![](images/image-533925408.png)\n\nEnter the numeric value for your group, enter the label and click 'add'\nand your label will be stored.\n\n**`Measure`** allows you to specify the measurement type for a variable,\nand sometimes this allows SPSS to deal with the data more accurately, so\nit is important.\n\n![](images/image-238199022.png){width=\"100\"}\n\nUse **`Scale`** if you are entering interval or ration data (i.e. where\nthe difference between scores on the scale is meaningful and\nstandardised; and intervals across the scale are equal) such as response\ntimes or accuracy rates.\n\n**`Ordinal`** if you have a categorical variable where the order of the\ncategories matter, such as Lickert Scales,\n\nand **`Nominal`** if you have a categorical variable where the order of\ncategories does not matter.\n\nYou can also further classify your data according to **`Role`** , but\nthis is not crucial.\n\n![](images/image-1428006537.png){width=\"100\"}\n\n**`Input`.** The variable will be used as an input (e.g., predictor,\nindependent variable).\n\n**`Target`.** The variable will be used as an output or target (e.g.,\ndependent variable).\n\n**`Both`.** The variable will be used as both input and output. This is\nthe case with some aspects of the 2x2 design, but don't get caught up\nwith this.\n\n**`None`.** The variable has no role assignment.\n\n**`Partition`.** The variable will be used to partition the data into\nseparate samples for training, testing, and validation. Or if you will\nexclude some participants based on the value.\n\n**`Split`.** Is used for advanced functions I won't go into here.\n\n## Inputting your data for the various 2x2 designs. {#sec-inputting-your-data-for-the-various-2x2-designs.}\n\nIn this series of toy examples, I'm running an experiment examining the\neffect of Puzzle Difficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and\nBackground Music (IV2 with 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in\nSeconds).\n\nYou will see that I couldn't quite make up my mind on what the optimal\n2x2 design was for this study, and so we can try it in all 3 'flavours'\nof 2x2 or two-way ANOVA\n\n-   Independent (or between-groups) ANOVA\n\n-   Repeated Measures (paired samples or within-participant) ANOVA\n\n-   Mixed ANOVA\n\nFor each design, I'll include a participant ID number (which is good\npractice) and I shall show the **Data View** with **numeric values** on\nthe left and with the **variable labels** on the right.\n\n![](images/image-514939274.png) This button toggles between the two and\nallows you to quickly see what you are working with.\n\nI'll then show you the **`Variable View`** , so that you can see how\nthey are set up.\n\nIf you know what your specific design is, you can jump to that section\nbelow, but I recommend you take the time to think about how data are\norganised for all of the 3 'flavours', as this will be useful next year.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tip: Syntax\n\nEven though your dataset may not yet be complete, you can dry-run the\nanalysis, and then re-run it using 'Syntax'. Simply put, syntax is the\ncode that runs the SPSS analysis behind the scenes.\n\nThis is something you could ask about in the labs if you are interested.\nIt's not something we usually teach.\n:::\n\n## 2x2 Independent (between-groups) ANOVA {#sec-2x2ind}\n\n> In an independent ANOVA, each participant belongs in only one\n> condition or cell in your 2x2 design grid, meaning that they are\n> allocated to only one condition for each of your IVs out of the\n> possible 4.\n\nSo in the example of my experiment examining the effect of Puzzle\nDifficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and Background Music (IV2\nwith 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in Seconds), I would\nrandomly allocate people to solve one puzzle ONLY after informed\nconsent. So there are four conditions and a participant in my study will\nonly do one of them.\n\nAn easy puzzle with slow background music, an easy puzzle with fast\nbackground music, a difficult puzzle with slow background music or a\ndifficult puzzle with fast background music.\n\nYou need to label the condition each participant was in for each of your\nIVs separately so that SPSS knows what puzzle condition they got and\nwhat music condition they got.\n\nAs always, each row corresponds to a single participant.\n\nIn this example, I've called Puzzle Difficulty **`IV1Difficulty`** so\nthat you can replace this in your mind with your first IV. I've used the\n**`Label`** and **`Values`** to identify Easy puzzle group with 1 and\nthe difficult puzzle group with 2. **`IV2MusicSpeed`** uses 1 to signify\nthe Slow music condition and 2 to signify the Fast music condition\n\nThe first panel shows this in data view with **`numeric values`** , the\nright panel with **`value labels`**. The **`Variable View`** shows how I\nset this up.\n\nThe DV in my study is `DVSolveTime` and is how many seconds it took to\nsolve the puzzle.\n\n[Download the 2x2 Independent ANOVA dataset\nhere](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1448200)\n\nData view numeric values\n\n![](images/image-939390968.png)\n\nData view with variable labels\n\n![](images/image-531484013.png)\n\nVariable view\n\n![](images/image-1065206573.png)\n\n## 2x2 Repeated Measures ANOVA {#sec-2x2RM}\n\n> In a repeated measures ANOVA, each participant does all four\n> conditions or cells in your 2x2 design grid. They would have been\n> given all four conditions from a possible four.\n\nSo, in the example of my experiment examining the effect of Puzzle\nDifficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and Background Music (IV2\nwith 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in Seconds), I would\nrandomly sequence the puzzles and music, but a participant in my study\nwould solve four puzzles making up all the possible combinations of\ndifficulty and music. In short, both levels of both of my IVs.\n\nEvery participant would have solved an easy puzzle with slow background\nmusic, an easy puzzle with fast background music, a difficult puzzle\nwith slow background music and a difficult puzzle with fast background\nmusic. Busy day!\n\nIn the previous example, we had one DV measure and needed to tell SPSS\nwhich condition the participant was in. In this example, we have 4\nmeasures of the DV (how long it took to solve each puzzle) so we need to\nlet SPSS see which response time corresponds to each condition.\n\nAs always, each row corresponds to a single participant.\n\nIn a repeated measures ANOVA setup, we don't need to use numbered groups\nor labels, instead we rely on using **`Name`** in **`Variable View`** to\nidentify each of the 4 conditions the participant experienced. So this\nis one of the simplest data sets.\n\n[Download the 2x2 Repeated Measures ANOVA dataset\nhere](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1448200)\n\nData view numeric values\n\n![](images/image-430396786.png)\n\nVariable View\n\n![](images/image-2026587323.png)\n\n## 2x2 Mixed ANOVA {#sec-2x2Mixed}\n\nAs you know, a repeated-measures ANOVA contains only\n**within-participant** variables (where participants take part in *all*\nconditions).\n\nAn independent ANOVA uses only **between-group** variables (where\nparticipants only take part in one condition),\n\n> A mixed ANOVA contains **BOTH** variable types. In this case, one of\n> each. You will necessarily have one within-participant IV and one\n> between-group IV.\n\nIn this last toy example using the puzzle music experiment, I decided\nthat participants were allocated to **either** the Easy or the Difficult\nPuzzle condition (puzzle difficulty is the between-group IV with 2\nlevels)\n\nEach participant then did two puzzles with both of the levels of the\nBackground Music condition, one puzzle with Slow background music, and\none puzzle with Fast background music (music is the within-participant\nIV with 2 levels).\n\nAs always, each row corresponds to a single participant.\n\nIn this case, each participant solved 2 puzzles and so needs two\nmeasures, but we need to identify the condition of the between-group IV\nthat they were in Easy Puzzles or Difficult Puzzles.\n\n[Download the 2x2 Mixed ANOVA dataset\nhere](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1448200)\n\nData view numeric values\n\n![](images/image-716864151.png)\n\nData view with variable labels\n\n![](images/image-2145723482.png)\n\nVariable view\n\n![](images/image-1872373620.png)\n\n## Some useful calculations in SPSS {#sec-some-useful-calculations-in-spss}\n\nSometimes your data is not yet entirely ready for analysis and you need\nto calculate a value to make your data make sense or to permit further\nanalysis. I shall present two useful calculations here.\n\nIt might be that you need to sum all the questions in a questionnaire to\nget a grand total. Or you need to find the average score on a group of\nquestions or trials in an experiment.\n\nI shall use that last example, **calculating a mean score** on a set of\ntrials, to illustrate this functionality, but you can do lots of useful\nthings the same way, simply by inserting variables in the SPSS dataset\ninto a calculation.\n\nAnother thing that many of you may need to do is to perform a **median\nsplit** , where you take a continuous variable such as a score on a\npersonality measure and 'cut it in half' so that 50% of your sample is\nconsidered low, and 50% is considered high.\n\nSo here's an experiment that needs me to do both of these things.\n\nIt's a 2x2 Mixed design experiment I ran recently, with 16 individuals\nin my dataset.\n\nI have allocated each participant a unique ID number, and I have age and\ngender as demographic characteristics.\n\nI have a variable to confirm their having given Informed Consent, and at\nthis point I have already removed any identifying information, and so\nthis is anonymous.\n\nParticipants completed a Psychopathy Questionnaire (The Triarchic\nPsychopathy Measure -- TriPM) giving me a possible score of between 0\nand 174 for each participant. I shall return to this measure when\ntalking about SPSS Scoring Syntax and Syntax more generally.\n\nThey then took part in a decision-making task, where they responded to\nchoices in 2 different scenarios. In one scenario they would be rewarded\nas part of a team, in another they would be rewarded individually. They\neach responded to two trials in each of the two conditions\n(within-subject IV with 2 levels - manipulation of reward type: team\nreward or individual reward).\n\nReaction Time was recorded for each trial to indicate how quickly the\nparticipant made the decision.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of the Variable View and Data View. You'll see that\nI need to complete the Median Split variable, and the two mean scores\nvariables at the right hand side.\n\nVariable View.\n\n![](images/image-530148639.png)\n\nData View with numeric values (e.g. gender 1,2,3)\n\n![](images/image-452186581.png)\n\nData View with value labels (using the value labels button above) (see\ngender)\n\n![](images/image-1264672667.png)\n\n## Performing a Median Split in SPSS {#sec-performing-a-median-split-in-spss}\n\nPerforming a median split allows you to categorise participants into\ndiscreet groups based on a continuous variable. You turn a continuous\nvariable into a dichotomous variable (low & high, for example). The\nmedian is used because it is the number at which point 50% of values lie\nabove, and 50% lie below. This means that usually, you get a nice equal\nsample size in both groups.\n\nThe median split procedure is sometimes better than using a cut off\nscore or threshold, as a median split uses the data that you have in\nhand, and doesn't assume anything about the sample of scores that you\nhave.\n\nI want to categorise my 16 participants into 'LowPsychopathy' and\n'HighPsychopathy' groups of equal size (hopefully) using a **median\nsplit** procedure (essentially turning this into a quasi-experimental\nbetween-group IV with 2 levels).\n\nI could just work out the median with descriptive statistics, and then\nby hand label each person as lower than the median or higher than the\nmedian. With 16 participants, it might be quicker to do it that way, but\nwith more it would be very dull indeed and I'd probably still get mixed\nup and make a mistake. So, I want to find a way to do it automatically\nand accurately.\n\nHere is the step-by-step procedure.\n\nGo to the **`Transform`** menu and select **`Visual Binning`**\n\n![](images/image-13544354.png){width=\"200\"}\n\nSimply put, this allows you to put participants into 'bins' based on a\nset of rules you make.\n\nSelect the variable you are going to use to divide people up. In this\ncase, I choose the total score for my TriPM Psychopathy measure\n(`TotalScoreTriPm`), move it into the **`Variables to Bin`** field and\nclick **`continue`**.\n\n![](images/image-1092678164.png)\n\nI'm then presented with this view of the distribution of the data.\n\n![](images/image-886603242.png)\n\nSo we want to find the median, or the point at which we cut the data in\nhalf. We click the **`Make Cutpoints`** button.\n\nIn the section marked **`Equal percentiles based on scanned`**`cases`\n**we input 1 in the** `number of cutpoints` **box and it automagically\nfills** 50% **in the** width **box. Click** `Apply`\n\n![](images/image-1289870961.png)\n\nThink about that. We asked SPSS to cut our variable into equal groups\nbased on observed data with a single chop! It could only ever be at the\nMedian! It's a funny set of commands, but makes sense, right?\n\nIf we asked for 2 cutpoints, it would give Low, Medium and High groups\ncut at 33.33% and 66.66%. Two cuts with equal numbers on each side = 3\ngroups -- a tertile split or trichotomized variable. But I digress.\n\nNow just label your new variable in the **`Binned Variable`** box and\nlabel the values.\n\nYou'll notice that for the data I used, the value is up to and including\n54 as low and anything over 54 is considered high. Bearing in mind the\nscale goes up to 174, and cutoff are usually much higher than 54, the\nmedian split is better for my data than that cutoff. There wouldn't be\nANYBODY in the high group.\n\n![](images/image-1118506612.png)\n\nWhen you click on `OK`, it pops a new variable at the end of the data\nset with the information you need (highlighted in blue below). From\nhere, I would move that variable to it's rightful place in my dataset,\nor copy and paste the values into the relevant column if I had already\nset it up. Alternatively, I could have given it exactly the same name in\nthe **`Binned Variable`** label setting and it would have replaced the\nempty cells. But I wanted you to see that new variables usually pop to\nthe far end of the data set.\n\n![](images/image-1710620886.png)\n\n## Calculating a mean score variable {#sec-calculating-a-mean-score-variable}\n\nNow to calculate the mean score across a series of variables. In this\ninstance, I want to calculate the mean response time for decisions in\nthe two individual reward trials, so that for each participant I have a\nmean response time across all trials of that type.\n\n![](images/image-379338339.png)\n\nFrom the **`Transform`** menu, you want to select **`Compute Variable`**\nand the following window will open up.\n\nFirstly, in **`Target Variabl`e** type in the name of the variable you\nwant to calculate. I've chosen '`Mean_IndividualReward`'.\n\nThen double click **`All`** in the **`Function group`:** dropdown to see\nall the calculations you could use. Scroll down to **`Mean`** in the\n**`Functions and Special Variables`** dropdown. Have a look at some of\nthe other options. You can see **`Sum`** and **`Sqrt`** for example,\nwhich is a calculated sum total and square root, respectively.\n\n![](images/image-1431336267.png)\n\nUsing the **little blue arrow** pointing upwards, put **`Mean`** into\nthe **`Numeric Expression`** box. This is where you put in a simple\nformula to tell SPSS how to calculate the new variable. You can use this\njust like a calculator, and insert a variable then + then another\nvariable using the calculator keyboard. It's super easy.\n\n![](images/image-1958330990.png)\n\nIt should look like the window above, and quite simply, you replace the\n'`?`' with the variables you want to use from the left hand column. So,\nyou can double click on the variables in the left hand column to send\nthem up to the **`Numeric Expression`** box and separate them with\ncommas.\n\n![](images/image-1943639971.png){width=\"400\"}\n\n![](images/image-1786701273.png){width=\"400\"}\n\nYou see I have calculated the mean of 2 trials, but you can do this for\nany number of variables. This is a useful tool and works like excel\nformulae. It will then just pop a new column at the end of your dataset\nwith the relevant output of the calculation.\n\n![](images/image-431115263.png){width=\"50\"}\n\nDo remember that if you want to perform other calculations, you can find\nexcellent help on the internet. Don't be afraid of trying things out and\nexploring the features of SPSS. It is confusing at times, but once you\nunderstand what it is trying to do, you'll find that it is very clever\nand can save you time.\n\n::: callout-warning\n**NOW SAVE YOUR DATA! AND STORE IT IN THE CLOUD!**\n\nYou do NOT want to have to redo things because your computer crashes!\n:::\n\nWell done and stay awesome!!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Open Data\n\n## Open Data requirements\n\nOpen Data is the concept of making research data accessible to everyone,\npromoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research -\nall critical features of an Open Science. In the field of psychology,\nsharing data is crucial for advancing scientific knowledge. This guide\nwill provide step-by-step instructions for creating an Open Data\nsubmission for a psychology research project such as the\nMini-Dissertation (and your Final Year Dissertations for that matter!).\n\n::: callout-important\n## Important\n\nIt is a compulsory that you submit your data. If you do not submit\nsomething, then your submission is not complete and the mark awarded\nwill be impacted.\n\nBy taking the time to produce a clear Open Data submission, you will\nenhance the overall quality of your submission, and this will be\nreflected in your mark.\n:::\n\n1.  Prepare your data: Before submitting your data, ensure that it is\n    well-organized, accurate, and complete. You might be fixated on\n    doing the analysis, but in many ways, the way you treat and\n    pre-process your data (prepare it for the analysis) is [even\n    more]{.underline} critical to reliable results.\n\n2.  This includes:\n\n    a\\. Cleaning and validating the data: Remove any errors,\n    inconsistencies, or missing values. This may be down to participant\n    error or a result of anything you might have done in this, your\n    first data collection exercise (mistakes are to be EXPECTED! Don't\n    hide them!). Make sure the data is properly formatted (an example\n    here might be consistent decimal places, or labelling in your\n    variable headers.\n\n    b\\. Anonymizing the data: To protect participants' privacy, remove\n    any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names,\n    addresses, or user generated codes. Replace these with unique\n    identifiers, if necessary. This can be as simple as a number from\n    1 - n (where n is your total sample size).\n\n3.  Create a data dictionary or codebook: A data dictionary is a simple\n    document that describes the variables in your dataset, their\n    definitions, units of measurement, and any coding schemes used, such\n    as values for any categorised data e.g. gender (1 = female, 2 =\n    male, 3 = prefer not to say).\n\n    This will help others understand and use your data more effectively.\n    Consider including the following information for each variable:\n\n    a.  Variable name as it exists in your dataset\n    b.  Variable description - what is the variable? Score on what\n        measure of your Open Materials?\n    c.  Data type (e.g., categorical, continuous, binary)\n    d.  Units of measurement (if applicable, milliseconds, hours per\n        day)\n    e.  Consider count information, or summary information (mean, range\n        etc)\n    f.  Coding scheme (if applicable, 1 = strongly disagree, 2 =\n        disagree etc.)\n\n4.  Information on any pre-processing you performed:\n\n    What were your decision rules on missing data or participant\n    exclusion? Your data set can be the original data set which includes\n    data you later do not analyse, or the data set that had undergone\n    pre-processing and had had all the missing values removed... in\n    either case, I want to know the process involved, so that I will be\n    able to do it if I try to replicate your analysis!\n\n5.  Choose a suitable format (or formats) for submission: In real\n    research, you could host this on OSF.io or a similar data\n    repository, but you are going to submit it as a supplementary file.\n    Choose a format (or formats) that are usable. Ideally, I would like\n    to be able to import your data directly, so it should be in a .csv,\n    .xlsx, or .sav file, but Jamovi, R or equivalent is fine too.\n\n    Any descriptive content (such as 3 or 4) could be in a pdf and\n    submitted alongside the Mini-Dissertation (you can submit up to 5\n    files)\n\nBy following these guidelines, you will contribute to a more transparent\nand collaborative research environment in the field of psychology,\nultimately promoting the advancement of scientific knowledge.\n\n\\raggedright\n\n## Week 14 - Getting set up to run your analysis\n\nGoals and outcomes of this week:\n\n-   A quick review of the SPSS Data editor window and some useful menu\n    options\n-   Inputting data into SPSS for your specific ANOVA design\n    -   [2x2 Independent (between-groups) ANOVA](#sec-2x2ind)\n    -   [2x2 Repeated measures ANOVA](#sec-2x2RM)\n    -   [2x2 Mixed ANOVA](#sec-2x2Mixed)\n-   Some useful calculations in SPSS\n    -   [Performing a Median Split in\n        SPSS](#sec-performing-a-median-split-in-spss)\n    -   [Calculating a mean score\n        variable](#sec-calculating-a-mean-score-variable)\n\n## Analysing your data starts here... with good set up! {#sec-analysing-your-data-starts-here...}\n\nI know that you have used SPSS plenty already, but it is normally the\ncase that you've only worked on downloaded pre-existing data sets, or\nfollowed step-by-step guides as a class. This time, these are YOUR data,\nof which you should be proud! Nobody has ever seen these data before.\n\n[Examples of the 3 flavours of dataset can be found on the\nVLE.](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1448200)\n\nFor your Mini-Dissertations you are going through all the stages of a\nresearch project, from idea origination, through to the final\npresentation of the report. One of the parts that often (unnecessarily)\ncauses anxiety is the analysis. Don't let it! You'll get lots of help in\nthe labs after Reading Week!\n\nIt is important that you go about the process of data preparation and\nanalysis methodically and with care. You've worked hard to generate\nthese data, give them the attention they deserve. And at the end of the\nprocess... you get to see what happened in your experiment.\n\nThis worksheet will offer you tools to start off well. I don't doubt\nthat you will have an occasional mishap, but that is how we learn and\nimprove. And I still google things sometimes!\n\nRemember, the mini-dissertation is carefully constrained to a 2x2\ndesign, but by using this as a case-study, we can equip you with all the\nskills necessary for something more exotic next year.\n\nWhen you open SPSS, you'll see the familiar Data Editor screen. Let me\npoint a few things out.\n\n![](images/image-416753022.png){width=\"300\"}\n\n![](images/image-1643419274.png) Open data document. This is where you\ncan navigate to open your data set. Obvious, I know.\n\n![](images/image-1272547429.png) This button saves your data set. Use\nthis regularly. And save your data set in the cloud. You do not want to\nhave to redo data preparation. And use version control. If you spend\ntime on a data set and reach the end of a session, save it with the date\nand start the next session with a copy. I dearly hope you listen to\nthis, and don't learn the hard way.\n\n![](images/image-1667930257.png) Recently used dialogues. Allows you to\npick from a dropdown menu of operations you have performed previously.\nMost people don't get to know this button exists and spend hours\nclicking through the menus. Using this button is the easiest way to do\nwhat you did last time, but make a slight modification (e.g. you forgot\nto select something).\n\n![](images/image-241978957.png) Most things that you do in the data\neditor window can be undone and redone. Anything that can't be undone\nwill give you a warning window. If you are going to try stuff out, use a\ncopy of your dataset and keep a safe copy of the last one you were\nworking on -- see Save button above.\n\n![](images/image-480798691.png) Flip between Value labels. You'll see\nhow this can be helpful later on. Just pointing it out for now.\n\n![](images/image-1370272646.png){width=\"150\"} Sometimes you want to look\nat your data (the numbers) and sometimes you want to look at what the\ndata are (labels and types of variables). `Data View` lets you look at\nthe numbers. Variable View lets you look at the labels and types of\nvariables in your data. Let's look at Variable View now.\n\nNow that you are reminded of those, let's get things ready for when your\ndata are ready.\n\n## Data input {#sec-data-input}\n\nIt may seem supremely dull, but properly formatting and labelling your\ndata is important. Remember that you will be uploading a dataset as part\nof your submission under Open Data. It is important that an outsider can\nunderstand your dataset and use it to reproduce your analysis, should\nthey wish.\n\n![](images/image-128904341.png){width=\"150\" height=\"20\"} We use the\n**`Variable View`** in SPSS to add and define the variables used in our\nstudy. Each row represents one of your variables. Here, we can give them\nsensible names and specify the type of data we are entering for each\none.\n\nSo start by thinking about **`Name`.** A variable name should be easy to\nunderstand and informative. You can't use spaces or symbols, so you\nshould think about using underscores or hyphens\nto-make-things_easier_to_understand.\n\n**`Type`** specifies the type of data that is contained in that\nvariable.\n\nWhen inputting your data, you will likely mostly use **`Numeric`,**\nwhich simply means it mostly numbers. It could be scores on a test, or\ncategories which might be relevant for gender or group membership\n(`1=Female, 2= Male, 3= Prefer not to say`, etc)\n\n![](images/image-1770594430.png)\n\n**`Width`** refers to the maximum number of characters in a given\nvariable. I don't think I've ever changed this from 8.\n\n**`Decimals`** allows you to specify if a value shows decimal places or\nnot. I've used 0 in some screengrabs below, so that decimal places are\nnot shown, and 2 decimal places in others. I would suggest sticking with\nthe default of 2, unless you are using very precise measurements.\n\n**`Label`** is VERY handy. It doesn't have the restrictions of `Name`,\nand so you can give a variable a really clear informative label. And it\nshows up in the output, meaning that the output is more easily\nunderstood. Do take the time to use this field, as once you step away\nfrom a dataset for even a couple of hours, it's possible to forget what\na variable is or represents.\n\n![](images/image-1725533457.png)\n\n`Value` is particularly useful for categorical variables (or nominal,\nnamed variables as SPSS prefers). Assign every group a name and SPSS\nwill attach that name to the output too. It's easier to compare output\nwith the labels 'Females' and 'Males' than '1' and '2'.\n\n![](images/image-533925408.png)\n\nEnter the numeric value for your group, enter the label and click 'add'\nand your label will be stored.\n\n**`Measure`** allows you to specify the measurement type for a variable,\nand sometimes this allows SPSS to deal with the data more accurately, so\nit is important.\n\n![](images/image-238199022.png){width=\"100\"}\n\nUse **`Scale`** if you are entering interval or ration data (i.e. where\nthe difference between scores on the scale is meaningful and\nstandardised; and intervals across the scale are equal) such as response\ntimes or accuracy rates.\n\n**`Ordinal`** if you have a categorical variable where the order of the\ncategories matter, such as Lickert Scales,\n\nand **`Nominal`** if you have a categorical variable where the order of\ncategories does not matter.\n\nYou can also further classify your data according to **`Role`** , but\nthis is not crucial.\n\n![](images/image-1428006537.png){width=\"100\"}\n\n**`Input`.** The variable will be used as an input (e.g., predictor,\nindependent variable).\n\n**`Target`.** The variable will be used as an output or target (e.g.,\ndependent variable).\n\n**`Both`.** The variable will be used as both input and output. This is\nthe case with some aspects of the 2x2 design, but don't get caught up\nwith this.\n\n**`None`.** The variable has no role assignment.\n\n**`Partition`.** The variable will be used to partition the data into\nseparate samples for training, testing, and validation. Or if you will\nexclude some participants based on the value.\n\n**`Split`.** Is used for advanced functions I won't go into here.\n\n## Inputting your data for the various 2x2 designs. {#sec-inputting-your-data-for-the-various-2x2-designs.}\n\nIn this series of toy examples, I'm running an experiment examining the\neffect of Puzzle Difficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and\nBackground Music (IV2 with 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in\nSeconds).\n\nYou will see that I couldn't quite make up my mind on what the optimal\n2x2 design was for this study, and so we can try it in all 3 'flavours'\nof 2x2 or two-way ANOVA\n\n-   Independent (or between-groups) ANOVA\n\n-   Repeated Measures (paired samples or within-participant) ANOVA\n\n-   Mixed ANOVA\n\nFor each design, I'll include a participant ID number (which is good\npractice) and I shall show the **Data View** with **numeric values** on\nthe left and with the **variable labels** on the right.\n\n![](images/image-514939274.png) This button toggles between the two and\nallows you to quickly see what you are working with.\n\nI'll then show you the **`Variable View`** , so that you can see how\nthey are set up.\n\nIf you know what your specific design is, you can jump to that section\nbelow, but I recommend you take the time to think about how data are\norganised for all of the 3 'flavours', as this will be useful next year.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tip: Syntax\n\nEven though your dataset may not yet be complete, you can dry-run the\nanalysis, and then re-run it using 'Syntax'. Simply put, syntax is the\ncode that runs the SPSS analysis behind the scenes.\n\nThis is something you could ask about in the labs if you are interested.\nIt's not something we usually teach.\n:::\n\n## 2x2 Independent (between-groups) ANOVA {#sec-2x2ind}\n\n> In an independent ANOVA, each participant belongs in only one\n> condition or cell in your 2x2 design grid, meaning that they are\n> allocated to only one condition for each of your IVs out of the\n> possible 4.\n\nSo in the example of my experiment examining the effect of Puzzle\nDifficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and Background Music (IV2\nwith 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in Seconds), I would\nrandomly allocate people to solve one puzzle ONLY after informed\nconsent. So there are four conditions and a participant in my study will\nonly do one of them.\n\nAn easy puzzle with slow background music, an easy puzzle with fast\nbackground music, a difficult puzzle with slow background music or a\ndifficult puzzle with fast background music.\n\nYou need to label the condition each participant was in for each of your\nIVs separately so that SPSS knows what puzzle condition they got and\nwhat music condition they got.\n\nAs always, each row corresponds to a single participant.\n\nIn this example, I've called Puzzle Difficulty **`IV1Difficulty`** so\nthat you can replace this in your mind with your first IV. I've used the\n**`Label`** and **`Values`** to identify Easy puzzle group with 1 and\nthe difficult puzzle group with 2. **`IV2MusicSpeed`** uses 1 to signify\nthe Slow music condition and 2 to signify the Fast music condition\n\nThe first panel shows this in data view with **`numeric values`** , the\nright panel with **`value labels`**. The **`Variable View`** shows how I\nset this up.\n\nThe DV in my study is `DVSolveTime` and is how many seconds it took to\nsolve the puzzle.\n\n[Download the 2x2 Independent ANOVA dataset\nhere](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1448200)\n\nData view numeric values\n\n![](images/image-939390968.png)\n\nData view with variable labels\n\n![](images/image-531484013.png)\n\nVariable view\n\n![](images/image-1065206573.png)\n\n## 2x2 Repeated Measures ANOVA {#sec-2x2RM}\n\n> In a repeated measures ANOVA, each participant does all four\n> conditions or cells in your 2x2 design grid. They would have been\n> given all four conditions from a possible four.\n\nSo, in the example of my experiment examining the effect of Puzzle\nDifficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and Background Music (IV2\nwith 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in Seconds), I would\nrandomly sequence the puzzles and music, but a participant in my study\nwould solve four puzzles making up all the possible combinations of\ndifficulty and music. In short, both levels of both of my IVs.\n\nEvery participant would have solved an easy puzzle with slow background\nmusic, an easy puzzle with fast background music, a difficult puzzle\nwith slow background music and a difficult puzzle with fast background\nmusic. Busy day!\n\nIn the previous example, we had one DV measure and needed to tell SPSS\nwhich condition the participant was in. In this example, we have 4\nmeasures of the DV (how long it took to solve each puzzle) so we need to\nlet SPSS see which response time corresponds to each condition.\n\nAs always, each row corresponds to a single participant.\n\nIn a repeated measures ANOVA setup, we don't need to use numbered groups\nor labels, instead we rely on using **`Name`** in **`Variable View`** to\nidentify each of the 4 conditions the participant experienced. So this\nis one of the simplest data sets.\n\n[Download the 2x2 Repeated Measures ANOVA dataset\nhere](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1448200)\n\nData view numeric values\n\n![](images/image-430396786.png)\n\nVariable View\n\n![](images/image-2026587323.png)\n\n## 2x2 Mixed ANOVA {#sec-2x2Mixed}\n\nAs you know, a repeated-measures ANOVA contains only\n**within-participant** variables (where participants take part in *all*\nconditions).\n\nAn independent ANOVA uses only **between-group** variables (where\nparticipants only take part in one condition),\n\n> A mixed ANOVA contains **BOTH** variable types. In this case, one of\n> each. You will necessarily have one within-participant IV and one\n> between-group IV.\n\nIn this last toy example using the puzzle music experiment, I decided\nthat participants were allocated to **either** the Easy or the Difficult\nPuzzle condition (puzzle difficulty is the between-group IV with 2\nlevels)\n\nEach participant then did two puzzles with both of the levels of the\nBackground Music condition, one puzzle with Slow background music, and\none puzzle with Fast background music (music is the within-participant\nIV with 2 levels).\n\nAs always, each row corresponds to a single participant.\n\nIn this case, each participant solved 2 puzzles and so needs two\nmeasures, but we need to identify the condition of the between-group IV\nthat they were in Easy Puzzles or Difficult Puzzles.\n\n[Download the 2x2 Mixed ANOVA dataset\nhere](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1448200)\n\nData view numeric values\n\n![](images/image-716864151.png)\n\nData view with variable labels\n\n![](images/image-2145723482.png)\n\nVariable view\n\n![](images/image-1872373620.png)\n\n## Some useful calculations in SPSS {#sec-some-useful-calculations-in-spss}\n\nSometimes your data is not yet entirely ready for analysis and you need\nto calculate a value to make your data make sense or to permit further\nanalysis. I shall present two useful calculations here.\n\nIt might be that you need to sum all the questions in a questionnaire to\nget a grand total. Or you need to find the average score on a group of\nquestions or trials in an experiment.\n\nI shall use that last example, **calculating a mean score** on a set of\ntrials, to illustrate this functionality, but you can do lots of useful\nthings the same way, simply by inserting variables in the SPSS dataset\ninto a calculation.\n\nAnother thing that many of you may need to do is to perform a **median\nsplit** , where you take a continuous variable such as a score on a\npersonality measure and 'cut it in half' so that 50% of your sample is\nconsidered low, and 50% is considered high.\n\nSo here's an experiment that needs me to do both of these things.\n\nIt's a 2x2 Mixed design experiment I ran recently, with 16 individuals\nin my dataset.\n\nI have allocated each participant a unique ID number, and I have age and\ngender as demographic characteristics.\n\nI have a variable to confirm their having given Informed Consent, and at\nthis point I have already removed any identifying information, and so\nthis is anonymous.\n\nParticipants completed a Psychopathy Questionnaire (The Triarchic\nPsychopathy Measure -- TriPM) giving me a possible score of between 0\nand 174 for each participant. I shall return to this measure when\ntalking about SPSS Scoring Syntax and Syntax more generally.\n\nThey then took part in a decision-making task, where they responded to\nchoices in 2 different scenarios. In one scenario they would be rewarded\nas part of a team, in another they would be rewarded individually. They\neach responded to two trials in each of the two conditions\n(within-subject IV with 2 levels - manipulation of reward type: team\nreward or individual reward).\n\nReaction Time was recorded for each trial to indicate how quickly the\nparticipant made the decision.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of the Variable View and Data View. You'll see that\nI need to complete the Median Split variable, and the two mean scores\nvariables at the right hand side.\n\nVariable View.\n\n![](images/image-530148639.png)\n\nData View with numeric values (e.g. gender 1,2,3)\n\n![](images/image-452186581.png)\n\nData View with value labels (using the value labels button above) (see\ngender)\n\n![](images/image-1264672667.png)\n\n## Performing a Median Split in SPSS {#sec-performing-a-median-split-in-spss}\n\nPerforming a median split allows you to categorise participants into\ndiscreet groups based on a continuous variable. You turn a continuous\nvariable into a dichotomous variable (low & high, for example). The\nmedian is used because it is the number at which point 50% of values lie\nabove, and 50% lie below. This means that usually, you get a nice equal\nsample size in both groups.\n\nThe median split procedure is sometimes better than using a cut off\nscore or threshold, as a median split uses the data that you have in\nhand, and doesn't assume anything about the sample of scores that you\nhave.\n\nI want to categorise my 16 participants into 'LowPsychopathy' and\n'HighPsychopathy' groups of equal size (hopefully) using a **median\nsplit** procedure (essentially turning this into a quasi-experimental\nbetween-group IV with 2 levels).\n\nI could just work out the median with descriptive statistics, and then\nby hand label each person as lower than the median or higher than the\nmedian. With 16 participants, it might be quicker to do it that way, but\nwith more it would be very dull indeed and I'd probably still get mixed\nup and make a mistake. So, I want to find a way to do it automatically\nand accurately.\n\nHere is the step-by-step procedure.\n\nGo to the **`Transform`** menu and select **`Visual Binning`**\n\n![](images/image-13544354.png){width=\"200\"}\n\nSimply put, this allows you to put participants into 'bins' based on a\nset of rules you make.\n\nSelect the variable you are going to use to divide people up. In this\ncase, I choose the total score for my TriPM Psychopathy measure\n(`TotalScoreTriPm`), move it into the **`Variables to Bin`** field and\nclick **`continue`**.\n\n![](images/image-1092678164.png)\n\nI'm then presented with this view of the distribution of the data.\n\n![](images/image-886603242.png)\n\nSo we want to find the median, or the point at which we cut the data in\nhalf. We click the **`Make Cutpoints`** button.\n\nIn the section marked **`Equal percentiles based on scanned`**`cases`\n**we input 1 in the** `number of cutpoints` **box and it automagically\nfills** 50% **in the** width **box. Click** `Apply`\n\n![](images/image-1289870961.png)\n\nThink about that. We asked SPSS to cut our variable into equal groups\nbased on observed data with a single chop! It could only ever be at the\nMedian! It's a funny set of commands, but makes sense, right?\n\nIf we asked for 2 cutpoints, it would give Low, Medium and High groups\ncut at 33.33% and 66.66%. Two cuts with equal numbers on each side = 3\ngroups -- a tertile split or trichotomized variable. But I digress.\n\nNow just label your new variable in the **`Binned Variable`** box and\nlabel the values.\n\nYou'll notice that for the data I used, the value is up to and including\n54 as low and anything over 54 is considered high. Bearing in mind the\nscale goes up to 174, and cutoff are usually much higher than 54, the\nmedian split is better for my data than that cutoff. There wouldn't be\nANYBODY in the high group.\n\n![](images/image-1118506612.png)\n\nWhen you click on `OK`, it pops a new variable at the end of the data\nset with the information you need (highlighted in blue below). From\nhere, I would move that variable to it's rightful place in my dataset,\nor copy and paste the values into the relevant column if I had already\nset it up. Alternatively, I could have given it exactly the same name in\nthe **`Binned Variable`** label setting and it would have replaced the\nempty cells. But I wanted you to see that new variables usually pop to\nthe far end of the data set.\n\n![](images/image-1710620886.png)\n\n## Calculating a mean score variable {#sec-calculating-a-mean-score-variable}\n\nNow to calculate the mean score across a series of variables. In this\ninstance, I want to calculate the mean response time for decisions in\nthe two individual reward trials, so that for each participant I have a\nmean response time across all trials of that type.\n\n![](images/image-379338339.png)\n\nFrom the **`Transform`** menu, you want to select **`Compute Variable`**\nand the following window will open up.\n\nFirstly, in **`Target Variabl`e** type in the name of the variable you\nwant to calculate. I've chosen '`Mean_IndividualReward`'.\n\nThen double click **`All`** in the **`Function group`:** dropdown to see\nall the calculations you could use. Scroll down to **`Mean`** in the\n**`Functions and Special Variables`** dropdown. Have a look at some of\nthe other options. You can see **`Sum`** and **`Sqrt`** for example,\nwhich is a calculated sum total and square root, respectively.\n\n![](images/image-1431336267.png)\n\nUsing the **little blue arrow** pointing upwards, put **`Mean`** into\nthe **`Numeric Expression`** box. This is where you put in a simple\nformula to tell SPSS how to calculate the new variable. You can use this\njust like a calculator, and insert a variable then + then another\nvariable using the calculator keyboard. It's super easy.\n\n![](images/image-1958330990.png)\n\nIt should look like the window above, and quite simply, you replace the\n'`?`' with the variables you want to use from the left hand column. So,\nyou can double click on the variables in the left hand column to send\nthem up to the **`Numeric Expression`** box and separate them with\ncommas.\n\n![](images/image-1943639971.png){width=\"400\"}\n\n![](images/image-1786701273.png){width=\"400\"}\n\nYou see I have calculated the mean of 2 trials, but you can do this for\nany number of variables. This is a useful tool and works like excel\nformulae. It will then just pop a new column at the end of your dataset\nwith the relevant output of the calculation.\n\n![](images/image-431115263.png){width=\"50\"}\n\nDo remember that if you want to perform other calculations, you can find\nexcellent help on the internet.
