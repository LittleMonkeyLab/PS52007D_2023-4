This should be something you have been aiming for all along, so we can move ahead.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 2\n\n2)  You have two categorical independent variables with two groups or levels in each. ANOVA works for more complex designs, with more than two levels of an IV, but again, you should have a **2x2 ANOVA** design.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 3\n\n3)  Your observations are independent, if you are running an independent or between-groups ANOVA. Independent means exactly what it sounds like, and should originate from separate trials of an individual participant, and not in any way related to another participant's data. This is obviously not the case if you are running a Mixed, or Repeated Measures ANOVA, as the within-participant measures are not independent, they come from the same individual.\n:::\n\n### **Parametric Assumptions (tested via SPSS)**\n\nIt is relatively common that your data may violate (i.e., fail) one or more of these three assumptions.\nIn each case, there are steps you can take to proceed, and these range from correcting your data in some way, choosing an alternative test, or just carrying on.\n\nIn your Mini-Dissertation, you are required to proceed with the ANOVA in the normal fashion and make it clear which of the assumptions were violated.\nWe wish to be able to assess you on following the procedure for the ANOVA you have learned this year.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf in doubt about what to do, please talk to your Lab Tutor.\n:::\n\nThe following assumptions refer to each cell of your design, and to the residuals, or error, from the ANOVA model, not the actual observed data.\nThis is worth remembering if you choose to do more advanced statistics, but, in essence, you can think about the assumptions being applied to the observed data (i.e. the data you have in your SPSS dataset).\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 4\n\n4\\) No significant outliers\n:::\n\nTesting this assumption can be done by producing a **`Boxplot`**.\nThese are pretty cool figures and offer a 'five number summary' of a variable; the median, the first and third quartiles, as well as the minimum and maximum values.\n\nBut what's really groovy, is that if a figure exceeds the interquartile range by 1.5x it's classed an 'outlier' and excluded.\nExceed the interquartile range by 3x and it's termed an 'extreme value' and excluded.\nOutliers get a little circle and Extreme Values get a star to denote them.\n\nSee below. \n \n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n![](images/image-150064313.png){width=\"200\"}\n\n![](images/image-956005521.png){width=\"200\"}\n\n![](images/image-2031782177.png){width=\"200\"}\n:::\n\nIn the first panel, you can see what all the lines in a boxplot refer to.\n\nThe gap between the First quartile and the median is the lower Inter Quartile Range (sometimes abbreviated to IQR) and if a value falls below the first quartile line by more than 1.5 times this value = outlier.\n\nThe same applies to values above the median, but the higher IQR is used.\n\nIn the second panel, I messed about with one of my variables which originally had a maximum value of 964 and had no outliers.\nI popped in a value of 1200, but this wasn't big enough to trigger the outlier warning, as the higher IQR is actually quite big.\n\nSo I had another go and made the new data value 1500.\nYou'll see that in the third panel.\nIt's the little circle with the number 7 beside it, identifying the row in my data that is an outlier.\n\nYou see the maximum value bar has dropped back to 964.\nSweet.\n\nRow 7 is an outlier and you can either exclude that participant, or proceed.\n\nIn either case, you should VERY CAREFULLY describe your choice.\nEven if you found no outliers, you should report that you conducted an examination of a boxplot.\n\n> E.g. \"No outliers were observed for the Dependent Variable, as determined by inspection of a boxplot\".\n\nTo run a boxplot.\nGo to **`Analyse,Descriptive Statistics`**, and then **`Explore`**, put your DV in the top box, and your (between-group) IVs together in the **`Factor List`** box.\n\nFor a between-groups design, or fully independent design, you will have two **`Factors (or IVs)`** and a single dependent variable.\n\nIf you have a Repeated Measures design, you will have four dependent variables and no **`Factors`**, for a mixed design, two dependent variables and one **`Factor`,** but the same process ensues. \n\n![](images/image-1886211170.png)\n\nClick on **`Plots`** and for the purposes of this, deselect **`Stem-and-leaf`** and click (and pay attention to) **`Normality plots with tests`.** You will need that later.Press **`continue`** and your plots will be produced.You will have plots for both levels of both of your IVs and you should consider them all in the same way as the single example I showed above.\n\n![](images/image-2135608430.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 5\n\n**Normality of distribution**\n:::\n\nThe two-way ANOVA assumes that the data are normally distributed in each cell of your ANOVA design.\nThis can be checked with a visual inspection of a Histogram, but I'm not confident doing that by eye, or you could look at the skewness and kurtosis values (look them up).\nBut the easiest way is the way you have already done. \n\nYes.\nYou clicked for the **`Normality plots with tests`** earlier under **`Explore`**, and this has produced some tests and a couple of plots above your boxplots. \n\nYou will see that a **`Shapiro-Wilk`** test has been run for each of the two levels of the independent variable.\nIn my toy example from last week, I had gender with 3 levels, and Psychopathy with a computed median split resulting in High Psychopathy and Low Psychopathy groups.\nThe green highlight shows how to identify the independent variable that is being tested for normality of the dependent variable (Individual Reward Trials in Milliseconds).\nIf you look at the **`Sig`.** column located under the **`Shapiro-Wilk`** column, you will find the significance value for this test for each group of the independent variable. \n\n![](images/image-1841930181.png)\n\nFor the purposes of this test, anything OVER *p* = .05 is good, correctly noted as (*p* \\> .05).\nThis just means that no alarms have gone off; the test is non-significant.\n\nSo in the toy example above, and in APA format: \n\n> Reaction times were normally distributed for both High Psychopathy group and Low Psychopathy groups, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk's test (High Psychopathy W(9)= .926, *p* = .447, Low Psychopathy W(6)= .944,  *p* = .692) however reaction times were normally distributed for females but not males (Females W(8)= .942, *p* = .628, Males W(5)= .740,  *p* = .024).\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 6\n\n**Homogeneity (or Equality) of Variances**\n:::\n\nThe final assumption we need to assess is the idea that the dependent variable is of roughly equal variance or spread in each cell of the design. \n\nThe assumption of homogeneity of variances is tested using **`Levene's test of equality of variances`**, which is found in the **`Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances table`**, as shown below. \n\nAs you can see, this just came in ABOVE our threshold at *p* = .052, meaning the assumption is met (just).\n\n![](images/image-1202599337.png)\n\nThis test can be performed as part of the ANOVA itself, and **`Homogeneity tests`** is what you need to select to have it included in your ANOVA output.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](images/image-1870994826.png)\n\n![](images/image-1429576185.png)\n:::\n\nRemember, the same rules apply for Levene's test as the Shapiro-Wilk test, we do **not** want to find a significant result (p \\< .05).\n\n## FOR MIXED DESIGNS\n\nA further assumption of the mixed ANOVA is that there are similar covariance matrices (don't worry about it until you start your MSc).\n\nYou can test for this with **`Box's test of equality of covariance matrices`**, which is presented in the **`Box's test of equality of covariance matrices table`,** as shown below:\n\n![](images/image-763650606.png){width=\"88\"}\n\nBut it is obtained by selecting for **`Homogeneity tests`** as with the previous examples, but you need to be on the look out for it to report it!\n\nAnd you [won't]{.underline} find the Levene test, so it's easy to get confused in the case of a mixed design.\n\n# ANOVA Analysis\n\nPlease refer to PS51008 Design & Analysis workbooks in Y1 for general overview of the ANOVA principles,\n\n::: callout\nWorkbook 5 - Unrelated (independent) ANOVA and post-hocs\n\n[Link to workbook 5 on VLE](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/2254170/mod_folder/content/0/SPSS%20Workbook%205.pdf?forcedownload=1)\n\nWorkbook 6 - Related (Repeated Measures) ANOVA and post-hocs\n\n[Link to workbook 6 on VLE](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/2254170/mod_folder/content/0/SPSS%20Workbook%206.pdf?forcedownload=1)\n:::\n\nIn PS52005 Design & Analysis in Y2, weeks 4-10 all deal with ANOVA in some way, so if anything is unclear, please pop over there and refresh yourself.\n\n<https://learn.gold.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=27556>\n\nThe first 2 SPSS Exercises dealt with analysis and write-up of ANOVAs of a similar type to the one you are facing now.\nHere's a VERY useful video <https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=1373589&chapterid=105274>\n\n## Make sure you are clear on your design!\n\n![Thanks for the slide \\@TeganPenton!](images/image-668233951.png){width=\"600\"}\n\n## Once you've got your design in mind...\n\nrefer to Lab 15 Worksheet in PS52007 for information on setting up your data and some preliminary pre-processing steps that may be relevant to you, such as Median Splits and computing mean scores across trials.\n\n![](images/image-1497306463.png)\n\n::: callout-caution\n## Median Splits are NOT terribly good practice!\n\nRemember, Median Splits reduce the amount of information in our data and can have nasty consequences on the results, such as inflating false positive error rates.\n\nWe ask you to use this process to dichotomise your continuous IVs to help you more quickly get up and running at the start of the year.\n\nIf you find yourself thinking about using this technique next year, please either reconsider your design, or use an analysis technique that is appropriate, such as a regression model or perhaps an ANCOVA - always consult your Supervisor!\n:::\n\n## It's time to do the analysis\n\nWell you are in safe hands.\n\nThe PS52005 Design & Analysis Lab 1 guide <https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1373590> has detailed guidance on each of the 3 flavours of ANOVA (see figure below).\nBoom.\n\n![](images/image-1012195800.png)\n\n## Writing f-statements\n\nNo.\nNot naughty language...

was significant, *F*(1,4) = 21.36, *p* = .01.\nOverall perceived pain scores were higher in the Opioid conditions (*M* = 59.9, *SD* = 4.05) compared to the Cannabinoid conditions (*M* = 54.6, *SD* = 3.42).\nThe main effect of Dosage was also significant, *F*(1,4) = 29.51, *p* = .006.\nOverall perceived pain scores were higher in single dose (*M* = 58.7, *SD* = 4.1) compared to double dose (*M* = 55.8, *SD* = 2.95).\nFinally, there was a significant interaction between Treatment and Dosage, *F*(1,4) = 15.23, *p* = .018.\n\nTo examine the cause of the significant interaction and to protect against inflation of likelihood of Type-I error, Bonferroni-corrected simple effects analyses were conducted.\nFirst, two t-tests (adjusted *α* = .025) examined the simple effects of Treatment within each Dosage condition.\nIn the single dose condition, perceived pain scores were significantly higher in the Opioid condition (*M* = 63.0, *SD* = 4.69) compared with the Cannabinoid condition (*M* = 54.4, *SD* = 3.65), *t*(4) = 10.59, *p* \\< .001.\nIn the double dose condition, perceived pain scores were not significantly different in the Opioid condition (*M* = 56.8, *SD* = 3.77) and the Cannabinoid condition (*M* = 54.8, *SD* = 3.42), *t*(4) = 1.09, *p* = .34.\n\nNext, two t-tests (adjusted *α* = .025) examined the simple effects of Dosage within each Treatment condition.\nFor Opioids, perceived pain scores were significantly higher in the single dose condition (*M* = 63.0, *SD* = 4.69) compared to double dose (*M* = 56.8, *SD* = 3.77), *t(*4) = 5.36, *p* = .006.\nFor Cannabinoids, perceived pain scores were not significantly different in the single dose condition (*M* = 54.4, *SD* = 3.65) compared to double dose (*M* = 54.8, *SD* = 3.42), *t*(4) = .49, *p* =

SPSS, so don't use screenshots like the above!\nStay tuned.\n\n## **Assumptions when using ANOVA**\n\nANOVA is a **'parametric'** test, meaning that it assumes the data you are analysing conforms to a series of underlying parameters, or features. \n\nANOVA doesn't usually collapse when these assumptions are not met, it's what we call 'robust', but you'd normally consider possible corrections, or alternative approaches to inferential test, such as non-parametric tests.\nBut you know all this from Design & Analysis!\n\n::: callout-important\n## Analysis required for the Mini-Dissertation\n\nRegardless of the assumptions being met or not, you are REQUIRED to perform an ANOVA and any necessary post-hoc tests for the Mini-Dissertation.\n\nThis is so that we can ensure you all achieve competency in this key learning outcome.\n\n \n:::\n\n### **Missing data**\n\nFirstly, and this isn't really an assumption strictly speaking, but you need to make sure you don't have any missing data.\nIf you have cells in your SPSS data set that are empty, SPSS will exclude that participant from any analyses that rely on the data.\nIt's just a fact that people drop out of studies, or miss questions.\nSo a certain number of participants, who haven't completed large parts of your study will have to be removed.\n\nIf you have received fabricated or synthesised data (i.e. simulated data in part or in whole) an **MCAR** filter has been applied, meaning that values have been removed randomly - i.e. there are some datapoints **M**issing **C**ompletely **A**t **R**andom\n\nBy running **`Descriptive Statistics`** you will be shown the **`N`** for each variable included.\nObviously, you may have one dependent variable, or you may have two or four.\nThey should all be equal (in an ideal world), but the **`Valid N (listwise)`** refers to the number of participants for whom you have complete data, and so would be the number used in an ANOVA.\nIf you have a few missing values in your data, you can do what's called a **mean imputation**, which is just a fancy way of replacing the missing values with the mean of all the other values of the same variable from the rest of your data set.\n\nYou can **`Transform`** the variable and **`Replace Missing Values`** using **`Series Mean`.** Or calculate the mean yourself and copy it into each missing cell of a particular value.\nIf you choose to do this, please make sure to document what you did for inclusion in your Mini-Dissertation submission - it needs to be reproducible!\n\nIf you think that you have more than just a few cases, please talk to your Lab Tutor and we can help resolve the issue and offer specific guidance. \n\n### **Assumptions (based on design and measurement)**\n\nWhen you choose to analyse your data using a two-way ANOVA, a critical part of the procedure is checking that the data you want to analyse can actually be analysed using this test.\nIn fact, the two-way ANOVA has five (or six) assumptions (depending on the flavour of ANOVA) that you have to consider, three of which you can test for using SPSS.\n\nI shall show you how to assess these three assumptions in SPSS and briefly explain how to interpret the results.\nBut before that, let's remind ourselves of the first three checks you should perform.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption

the test is non-significant.\n\nSo in the toy example above, and in APA format: \n\n> Reaction times were normally distributed for both High Psychopathy group and Low Psychopathy groups, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk's test (High Psychopathy W(9)= .926, *p* = .447, Low Psychopathy W(6)= .944,  *p* = .692) however reaction times were normally distributed for females but not males (Females W(8)= .942, *p* = .628, Males W(5)= .740,  *p* = .024).\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 6\n\n**Homogeneity (or Equality) of Variances**\n:::\n\nThe final assumption we need to assess is the idea that the dependent variable is of roughly equal variance or spread in each cell of the design. \n\nThe assumption of homogeneity of variances is tested using **`Levene's test of equality of variances`**, which is found in the **`Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances table`**, as shown below. \n\nAs you can see, this just came in ABOVE our threshold at *p* = .052, meaning the assumption is met (just).\n\n![](images/image-1202599337.png)\n\nThis test can be performed as part of the ANOVA itself, and **`Homogeneity tests`** is what you need to select to have it included in your ANOVA output.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](images/image-1870994826.png)\n\n![](images/image-1429576185.png)\n:::\n\nRemember, the same rules apply for Levene's test as the Shapiro-Wilk test, we do **not** want to find a significant result (p \\< .05).\n\n## FOR MIXED DESIGNS\n\nA further assumption of the mixed ANOVA is that there are similar covariance matrices (don't worry about it until you start your MSc).\n\nYou can test for this with **`Box's test of equality of covariance matrices`**, which is presented in the **`Box's test of equality of covariance matrices table`,** as shown below:\n\n![](images/image-763650606.png){width=\"88\"}\n\nBut it is obtained by selecting for **`Homogeneity tests`** as with the previous examples, but you need to be on the look out for it to report it!\n\nAnd you [won't]{.underline} find the Levene test, so it's easy to get confused in the case of a mixed design.\n\n# ANOVA Analysis\n\nPlease refer to PS51008 Design & Analysis workbooks in Y1 for general overview of the ANOVA principles,\n\n::: callout\nWorkbook 5 - Unrelated (independent) ANOVA and post-hocs\n\n[Link to workbook 5 on VLE](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/2254170/mod_folder/content/0/SPSS%20Workbook%205.pdf?forcedownload=1)\n\nWorkbook 6 - Related (Repeated Measures) ANOVA and post-hocs\n\n[Link to workbook 6 on VLE](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/2254170/mod_folder/content/0/SPSS%20Workbook%206.pdf?forcedownload=1)\n:::\n\nIn PS52005 Design & Analysis in Y2, weeks 4-10 all deal with ANOVA in some way, so if anything is unclear, please pop over there and refresh yourself.\n\n<https://learn.gold.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=27556>\n\nThe first 2 SPSS Exercises dealt with analysis and write-up of ANOVAs of a similar type to the one you are facing now.\nHere's a VERY useful video <https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=1373589&chapterid=105274>\n\n## Make sure you are clear on your design!\n\n![Thanks for the slide \\@TeganPenton!](images/image-668233951.png){width=\"600\"}\n\n## Once you've got your design in mind...\n\nrefer to Lab 15 Worksheet in PS52007 for information on setting up your data and some preliminary pre-processing steps that may be relevant to you, such as Median Splits and computing mean scores across trials.\n\n![](images/image-1497306463.png)\n\n::: callout-caution\n## Median Splits are NOT terribly good practice!\n\nRemember, Median Splits reduce the amount of information in our data and can have nasty consequences on the results, such as inflating false positive error rates.\n\nWe ask you to use this process to dichotomise your continuous IVs to help you more quickly get up and running at the start of the year.\n\nIf you find yourself thinking about using this technique next year, please either reconsider your design, or use an analysis technique that is appropriate, such as a regression model or perhaps an ANCOVA - always consult your Supervisor!\n:::\n\n## It's time to do the analysis\n\nWell you are in safe hands.\n\nThe PS52005 Design & Analysis Lab 1 guide <https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1373590> has detailed guidance on each of the 3 flavours of ANOVA (see figure below).\nBoom.\n\n![](images/image-1012195800.png)\n\n## Writing f-statements\n\nNo.\nNot naughty language...

was significant, *F*(1,4) = 21.36, *p* = .01.\nOverall perceived pain scores were higher in the Opioid conditions (*M* = 59.9, *SD* = 4.05) compared to the Cannabinoid conditions (*M* = 54.6, *SD* = 3.42).\nThe main effect of Dosage was also significant, *F*(1,4) = 29.51, *p* = .006.\nOverall perceived pain scores were higher in single dose (*M* = 58.7, *SD* = 4.1) compared to double dose (*M* = 55.8, *SD* = 2.95).\nFinally, there was a significant interaction between Treatment and Dosage, *F*(1,4) = 15.23, *p* = .018.\n\nTo examine the cause of the significant interaction and to protect against inflation of likelihood of Type-I error, Bonferroni-corrected simple effects analyses were conducted.\nFirst, two t-tests (adjusted *α* = .025) examined the simple effects of Treatment within each Dosage condition.\nIn the single dose condition, perceived pain scores were significantly higher in the Opioid condition (*M* = 63.0, *SD* = 4.69) compared with the Cannabinoid condition (*M* = 54.4, *SD* = 3.65), *t*(4) = 10.59, *p* \\< .001.\nIn the double dose condition, perceived pain scores were not significantly different in the Opioid condition (*M* = 56.8, *SD* = 3.77) and the Cannabinoid condition (*M* = 54.8, *SD* = 3.42), *t*(4) = 1.09, *p* = .34.\n\nNext, two t-tests (adjusted *α* = .025) examined the simple effects of Dosage within each Treatment condition.\nFor Opioids, perceived pain scores were significantly higher in the single dose condition (*M* = 63.0, *SD* = 4.69) compared to double dose (*M* = 56.8, *SD* = 3.77), *t(*4) = 5.36, *p* = .006.\nFor Cannabinoids, perceived pain scores were not significantly different in the single dose condition (*M* = 54.4, *SD* = 3.65) compared to double dose (*M* = 54.8, *SD* = 3.42), *t*(4) = .49, *p* = .65).\n:::\n\n## So you have all the resources available to you that you could possibly need.\n\nBut do remember that you can use the lab sessions in the coming weeks to get confirmation that you are doing the right thing and making proper progress.\n\nThere is NO REASON why your lab tutor would not give you clear feedback or help you identify any issues.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Please remember\\...\n\nEveryone gets anxious about running the analysis.\nIt's just not worth it.\nThe analysis is a very small part of the Mini-Dissertation, and actually requires no creativity in the least.\n\nDo it once, do it right, and move onto the more interesting part of interpreting the results.\n\nYou just need to patiently follow the guides mentioned above.\nIf you get onto it ASAP, you can use the lab sessions to check your work.\n\n**Be advised that the lab sessions may get busier towards the end of the term, so prioritise this if you think it is potentially something you would
