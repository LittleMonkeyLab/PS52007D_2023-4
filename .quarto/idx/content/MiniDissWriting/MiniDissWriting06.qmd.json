But you know all this from Design & Analysis!\n\n::: callout-important\n## Analysis required for the Mini-Dissertation\n\nRegardless of the assumptions being met or not, you are REQUIRED to\nperform an ANOVA and any necessary post-hoc tests for the\nMini-Dissertation.\n\nThis is so that we can ensure you all achieve competency in this key\nlearning outcome.\n\n \n:::\n\n### **Missing data**\n\nFirstly, and this isn't really an assumption strictly speaking, but you\nneed to make sure you don't have any missing data. If you have cells in\nyour SPSS data set that are empty, SPSS will exclude that participant\nfrom any analyses that rely on the data. It's just a fact that people\ndrop out of studies, or miss questions. So a certain number of\nparticipants, who haven't completed large parts of your study will have\nto be removed.\n\nIf you have received fabricated or synthesised data (i.e. simulated data\nin part or in whole) an **MCAR** filter has been applied, meaning that\nvalues have been removed randomly - i.e. there are some datapoints\n**M**issing **C**ompletely **A**t **R**andom\n\nBy running **`Descriptive Statistics`** you will be shown the **`N`**\nfor each variable included. Obviously, you may have one dependent\nvariable, or you may have two or four. They should all be equal (in an\nideal world), but the **`Valid N (listwise)`** refers to the number of\nparticipants for whom you have complete data, and so would be the number\nused in an ANOVA. If you have a few missing values in your data, you can\ndo what's called a **mean imputation**, which is just a fancy way of\nreplacing the missing values with the mean of all the other values of\nthe same variable from the rest of your data set.\n\nYou can **`Transform`** the variable and **`Replace Missing Values`**\nusing **`Series Mean`.** Or calculate the mean yourself and copy it into\neach missing cell of a particular value. If you choose to do this,\nplease make sure to document what you did for inclusion in your\nMini-Dissertation submission - it needs to be reproducible!\n\nIf you think that you have more than just a few cases, please talk to\nyour Lab Tutor and we can help resolve the issue and offer specific\nguidance. \n\n### **Assumptions (based on design and measurement)**\n\nWhen you choose to analyse your data using a two-way ANOVA, a critical\npart of the procedure is checking that the data you want to analyse can\nactually be analysed using this test. In fact, the two-way ANOVA has\nfive (or six) assumptions (depending on the flavour of ANOVA) that you\nhave to consider, three of which you can test for using SPSS.\n\nI shall show you how to assess these three assumptions in SPSS and\nbriefly explain how to interpret the results. But before that, let's\nremind ourselves of the first three checks you should perform.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 1\n\n1)  You need to have a continuous dependent variable. This should be\n    something you have been aiming for all along, so we can move ahead.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 2\n\n2)  You have two categorical independent variables with two groups or\n    levels in each. ANOVA works for more complex designs, with more than\n    two levels of an IV, but again, you should have a **2x2 ANOVA**\n    design.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 3\n\n3)  Your observations are independent, if you are running an independent\n    or between-groups ANOVA. Independent means exactly what it sounds\n    like, and should originate from separate trials of an individual\n    participant, and not in any way related to another participant's\n    data. This is obviously not the case if you are running a Mixed, or\n    Repeated Measures ANOVA, as the within-participant measures are not\n    independent, they come from the same individual.\n:::\n\n### **Parametric Assumptions (tested via SPSS)**\n\nIt is relatively common that your data may violate (i.e., fail) one or\nmore of these three assumptions. In each case, there are steps you can\ntake to proceed, and these range from correcting your data in some way,\nchoosing an alternative test, or just carrying on.\n\nIn your Mini-Dissertation, you are required to proceed with the ANOVA in\nthe normal fashion and make it clear which of the assumptions were\nviolated. We wish to be able to assess you on following the procedure\nfor the ANOVA you have learned this year.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf in doubt about what to do, please talk to your Lab Tutor.\n:::\n\n::: aside\nA brief note that you can gloss over if you wish.\n:::\n\nThe following assumptions refer to each cell of your design, and to the\nresiduals, or error, from the ANOVA model, not the actual observed data.\nThis is worth remembering if you choose to do more advanced statistics,\nbut, in essence, you can think about the assumptions being applied to\nthe observed data (i.e. the data you have in your SPSS dataset).\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 4\n\n4\\) No significant outliers\n:::\n\nTesting this assumption can be done by producing a **`Boxplot`**. These\nare pretty cool figures and offer a 'five number summary' of a variable;\nthe median, the first and third quartiles, as well as the minimum and\nmaximum values.\n\nBut what's really groovy, is that if a figure exceeds the interquartile\nrange by 1.5x it's classed an 'outlier' and excluded. Exceed the\ninterquartile range by 3x and it's termed an 'extreme value' and\nexcluded. Outliers get a little circle and Extreme Values get a star to\ndenote them.\n\nSee below.   \n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n![](images/image-150064313.png){width=\"200\"}\n\n![](images/image-956005521.png){width=\"200\"}\n\n![](images/image-2031782177.png){width=\"200\"}\n:::\n\nIn the first panel, you can see what all the lines in a boxplot refer\nto.\n\nThe gap between the First quartile and the median is the lower Inter\nQuartile Range (sometimes abbreviated to IQR) and if a value falls below\nthe first quartile line by more than 1.5 times this value = outlier.\n\nThe same applies to values above the median, but the higher IQR is used.\n\nIn the second panel, I messed about with one of my variables which\noriginally had a maximum value of 964 and had no outliers. I popped in a\nvalue of 1200, but this wasn't big enough to trigger the outlier\nwarning, as the higher IQR is actually quite big.\n\nSo I had another go and made the new data value 1500. You'll see that in\nthe third panel. It's the little circle with the number 7 beside it,\nidentifying the row in my data that is an outlier.\n\nYou see the maximum value bar has dropped back to 964. Sweet.\n\nRow 7 is an outlier and you can either exclude that participant, or\nproceed.\n\nIn either case, you should VERY CAREFULLY describe your choice. Even if\nyou found no outliers, you should report that you conducted an\nexamination of a boxplot.\n\n> E.g. \"No outliers were observed for the Dependent Variable, as\n> determined by inspection of a boxplot\".\n\nTo run a boxplot. Go to **`Analyse,Descriptive Statistics`**, and then\n**`Explore`**, put your DV in the top box, and your (between-group) IVs\ntogether in the **`Factor List`** box.\n\nFor a between-groups design, or fully independent design, you will have\ntwo **`Factors (or IVs)`** and a single dependent variable.\n\nIf you have a Repeated Measures design, you will have four dependent\nvariables and no **`Factors`**, for a mixed design, two dependent\nvariables and one **`Factor`,** but the same process ensues. \n\n![](images/image-1886211170.png)\n\nClick on **`Plots`** and for the purposes of this, deselect\n**`Stem-and-leaf`** and click (and pay attention to)\n**`Normality plots with tests`.** You will need that later.Press\n**`continue`** and your plots will be produced.You will have plots for\nboth levels of both of your IVs and you should consider them all in the\nsame way as the single example I showed above.\n\n![](images/image-2135608430.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 5\n\n**Normality of distribution**\n:::\n\nThe two-way ANOVA assumes that the data are normally distributed in each\ncell of your ANOVA design. This can be checked with a visual inspection\nof a Histogram, but I'm not confident doing that by eye, or you could\nlook at the skewness and kurtosis values (look them up). But the easiest\nway is the way you have already done. \n\nYes. You clicked for the **`Normality plots with tests`** earlier under\n**`Explore`**, and this has produced some tests and a couple of plots\nabove your boxplots. \n\nYou will see that a **`Shapiro-Wilk`** test has been run for each of the\ntwo levels of the independent variable. In my toy example from last\nweek, I had gender with 3 levels, and Psychopathy with a computed median\nsplit resulting in High Psychopathy and Low Psychopathy groups. The\ngreen highlight shows how to identify the independent variable that is\nbeing tested for normality of the dependent variable (Individual Reward\nTrials in Milliseconds). If you look at the **`Sig`.** column located\nunder the **`Shapiro-Wilk`** column, you will find the significance\nvalue for this test for each group of the independent variable. \n\n![](images/image-1841930181.png)\n\nFor the purposes of this test, anything OVER *p* = .05 is good,\ncorrectly noted as (*p* \\> .05). This just means that no alarms have\ngone off; the test is non-significant.\n\nSo in the toy example above, and in APA format: \n\n> Reaction times were normally distributed for both High Psychopathy\n> group and Low Psychopathy groups, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk's test\n> (High Psychopathy W(9)= .926, *p* = .447, Low Psychopathy W(6)= .944, \n> *p* = .692) however reaction times were normally distributed for\n> females but not males (Females W(8)= .942, *p* = .628, Males W(5)=\n> .740,  *p* = .024).\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 6\n\n**Homogeneity (or Equality) of Variances**\n:::\n\nThe final assumption we need to assess is the idea that the dependent\nvariable is of roughly equal variance or spread in each cell of the\ndesign. \n\nThe assumption of homogeneity of variances is tested using\n**`Levene's test of equality of variances`**, which is found in the\n**`Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances table`**, as shown\nbelow. \n\nAs you can see, this just came in ABOVE our threshold at *p* = .052,\nmeaning the assumption is met (just).\n\n![](images/image-1202599337.png)\n\nThis test can be performed as part of the ANOVA itself, and\n**`Homogeneity tests`** is what you need to select to have it included\nin your ANOVA output.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](images/image-1870994826.png)\n\n![](images/image-1429576185.png)\n:::\n\nRemember, the same rules apply for Levene's test as the Shapiro-Wilk\ntest, we do **not** want to find a significant result (p \\< .05).\n\n## FOR MIXED DESIGNS\n\nA further assumption of the mixed ANOVA is that there are similar\ncovariance matrices (don't worry about it until you start your MSc).\n\nYou can test for this with\n**`Box's test of equality of covariance matrices`**, which is presented\nin the **`Box's test of equality of covariance matrices table`,** as\nshown below:\n\n![](images/image-763650606.png){width=\"88\"}\n\nBut it is obtained by selecting for **`Homogeneity tests`** as with the\nprevious examples, but you need to be on the look out for it to report\nit!\n\nAnd you [won't]{.underline} find the Levene test, so it's easy to get\nconfused in the case of a mixed design.\n\n# ANOVA Analysis\n\nPlease refer to PS51008 Design & Analysis workbooks in Y1 for general\noverview of the ANOVA principles,\n\n::: callout\nWorkbook 5 - Unrelated (independent) ANOVA and post-hocs\n\n[Link to workbook 5 on\nVLE](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1928976/mod_folder/content/0/SPSS%20Workbook%205.pdf)\n\nWorkbook 6 - Related (Repeated Measures) ANOVA and post-hocs\n\n[Link to workbook 6 on\nVLE](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1928976/mod_folder/content/0/SPSS%20Workbook%206.pdf)\n:::\n\nIn PS52005 Design & Analysis in Y2, weeks 4-10 all deal with ANOVA in\nsome way, so if anything is unclear, please pop over there and refresh\nyourself.\n\n<https://learn.gold.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=24470>\n\nThe first 2 SPSS Exercises dealt with analysis and write-up of ANOVAs of\na similar type to the one you are facing now.

Go to **`Analyse,Descriptive Statistics`**, and then\n**`Explore`**, put your DV in the top box, and your (between-group) IVs\ntogether in the **`Factor List`** box.\n\nFor a between-groups design, or fully independent design, you will have\ntwo **`Factors (or IVs)`** and a single dependent variable.\n\nIf you have a Repeated Measures design, you will have four dependent\nvariables and no **`Factors`**, for a mixed design, two dependent\nvariables and one **`Factor`,** but the same process ensues. \n\n![](images/image-1886211170.png)\n\nClick on **`Plots`** and for the purposes of this, deselect\n**`Stem-and-leaf`** and click (and pay attention to)\n**`Normality plots with tests`.** You will need that later.Press\n**`continue`** and your plots will be produced.You will have plots for\nboth levels of both of your IVs and you should consider them all in the\nsame way as the single example I showed above.\n\n![](images/image-2135608430.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 5\n\n**Normality of distribution**\n:::\n\nThe two-way ANOVA assumes that the data are normally distributed in each\ncell of your ANOVA design. This can be checked with a visual inspection\nof a Histogram, but I'm not confident doing that by eye, or you could\nlook at the skewness and kurtosis values (look them up). But the easiest\nway is the way you have already done. \n\nYes. You clicked for the **`Normality plots with tests`** earlier under\n**`Explore`**, and this has produced some tests and a couple of plots\nabove your boxplots. \n\nYou will see that a **`Shapiro-Wilk`** test has been run for each of the\ntwo levels of the independent variable. In my toy example from last\nweek, I had gender with 3 levels, and Psychopathy with a computed median\nsplit resulting in High Psychopathy and Low Psychopathy groups. The\ngreen highlight shows how to identify the independent variable that is\nbeing tested for normality of the dependent variable (Individual Reward\nTrials in Milliseconds). If you look at the **`Sig`.** column located\nunder the **`Shapiro-Wilk`** column, you will find the significance\nvalue for this test for each group of the independent variable. \n\n![](images/image-1841930181.png)\n\nFor the purposes of this test, anything OVER *p* = .05 is good,\ncorrectly noted as (*p* \\> .05). This just means that no alarms have\ngone off; the test is non-significant.\n\nSo in the toy example above, and in APA format: \n\n> Reaction times were normally distributed for both High Psychopathy\n> group and Low Psychopathy groups, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk's test\n> (High Psychopathy W(9)= .926, *p* = .447, Low Psychopathy W(6)= .944, \n> *p* = .692) however reaction times were normally distributed for\n> females but not males (Females W(8)= .942, *p* = .628, Males W(5)=\n> .740,  *p* = .024).\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Assumption 6\n\n**Homogeneity (or Equality) of Variances**\n:::\n\nThe final assumption we need to assess is the idea that the dependent\nvariable is of roughly equal variance or spread in each cell of the\ndesign. \n\nThe assumption of homogeneity of variances is tested using\n**`Levene's test of equality of variances`**, which is found in the\n**`Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances table`**, as shown\nbelow. \n\nAs you can see, this just came in ABOVE our threshold at *p* = .052,\nmeaning the assumption is met (just).\n\n![](images/image-1202599337.png)\n\nThis test can be performed as part of the ANOVA itself, and\n**`Homogeneity tests`** is what you need to select to have it included\nin your ANOVA output.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](images/image-1870994826.png)\n\n![](images/image-1429576185.png)\n:::\n\nRemember, the same rules apply for Levene's test as the Shapiro-Wilk\ntest, we do **not** want to find a significant result (p \\< .05).\n\n## FOR MIXED DESIGNS\n\nA further assumption of the mixed ANOVA is that there are similar\ncovariance matrices (don't worry about it until you start your MSc).\n\nYou can test for this with\n**`Box's test of equality of covariance matrices`**, which is presented\nin the **`Box's test of equality of covariance matrices table`,** as\nshown below:\n\n![](images/image-763650606.png){width=\"88\"}\n\nBut it is obtained by selecting for **`Homogeneity tests`** as with the\nprevious examples, but you need to be on the look out for it to report\nit!\n\nAnd you [won't]{.underline} find the Levene test, so it's easy to get\nconfused in the case of a mixed design.\n\n# ANOVA Analysis\n\nPlease refer to PS51008 Design & Analysis workbooks in Y1 for general\noverview of the ANOVA principles,\n\n::: callout\nWorkbook 5 - Unrelated (independent) ANOVA and post-hocs\n\n[Link to workbook 5 on\nVLE](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1928976/mod_folder/content/0/SPSS%20Workbook%205.pdf)\n\nWorkbook 6 - Related (Repeated Measures) ANOVA and post-hocs\n\n[Link to workbook 6 on\nVLE](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1928976/mod_folder/content/0/SPSS%20Workbook%206.pdf)\n:::\n\nIn PS52005 Design & Analysis in Y2, weeks 4-10 all deal with ANOVA in\nsome way, so if anything is unclear, please pop over there and refresh\nyourself.\n\n<https://learn.gold.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=24470>\n\nThe first 2 SPSS Exercises dealt with analysis and write-up of ANOVAs of\na similar type to the one you are facing now.

The main\neffect of Treatment was significant, *F*(1,4) = 21.36, *p* = .01.\nOverall perceived pain scores were higher in the Opioid conditions (*M*\n= 59.9, *SD* = 4.05) compared to the Cannabinoid conditions (*M* = 54.6,\n*SD* = 3.42). The main effect of Dosage was also significant, *F*(1,4) =\n29.51, *p* = .006. Overall perceived pain scores were higher in single\ndose (*M* = 58.7, *SD* = 4.1) compared to double dose (*M* = 55.8, *SD*\n= 2.95). Finally, there was a significant interaction between Treatment\nand Dosage, *F*(1,4) = 15.23, *p* = .018.\n\nTo examine the cause of the significant interaction and to protect\nagainst inflation of likelihood of Type-I error, Bonferroni-corrected\nsimple effects analyses were conducted. First, two t-tests (adjusted *α*\n= .025) examined the simple effects of Treatment within each Dosage\ncondition. In the single dose condition, perceived pain scores were\nsignificantly higher in the Opioid condition (*M* = 63.0, *SD* = 4.69)\ncompared with the Cannabinoid condition (*M* = 54.4, *SD* = 3.65),\n*t*(4) = 10.59, *p* \\< .001.

For Opioids, perceived pain\nscores were significantly higher in the single dose condition (*M* =\n63.0, *SD* = 4.69) compared to double dose (*M* = 56.8, *SD* = 3.77),\n*t(*4) = 5.36, *p* = .006.
