In-person attendance is optimal as we\nwill spend a lot of time working on your Mini-Dissertations and research\nskills. The best idea is to 'keep up, don't catch up' but of course,\nlife happens. We know this and will try to help you whenever we can, but\nwe can't offer Extenuating Circumstances or mark you as present etc. You\nshould try to update your Personal Tutor, Lab Tutor and research group\nmembers if you anticipate missing a session.\n\nLab Sessions are NOT recorded either. Any activities or resources will\nbe available via the VLE or this site, but it is your responsibility to\nkeep abreast of your group progress and to catch up if necessary.\n\n# Learning Objectives\n\nStudents who successfully complete this module will be able to:\n\n-   Show a critical understanding of research design and methodology\n-   Design, conduct, analyse, interpret and disseminate psychological\n    research\n-   Understand the conceptual and historical issues concerned with\n    psychology as a science and area of practical application\n-   Demonstrate valuable time-management and collaborative\n    project-management skills and proficiencies\n-   Reflect on their own learning, skill development and metacognition,\n    preparing them for the final year dissertation\n\n# Pep Talk!\n\nYou might be intimidated by the idea of 'Research Methods' or the\nprospect of running a piece of real research. This is understandable,\nbut really not necessary.\n\nIf you are able to manage your independent study, attend labs and view\nthese sessions as 'working sessions', you'll do just fine. By viewing\nyour Lab Tutor as your 'Supervisor' and developing a dialogue with them\neach week, updating them with successes AND problems, you will get the\nbest support available. Please don't panic, and please don't stay quiet.\nThe sooner you address any problems or issues, the sooner we can fix\nthem and get you back on track.\n\nThe biggest tip I can offer is around note-taking. Keeping good notes, a\n'lab notebook' if you like, and gradually building a source of 'truth',\nis crucial to success on this module. We will be supporting this, but I\nencourage you to find a process that works for you. Make sure that your\nnotes are available AT ALL TIMES. Use a cloud-based system (University\nMicrosoft resources such as OneDrive and OneNote are free). Make sure to\nback up your drafts and notes. Your Lab Tutors will ask to see your\nnotes to see what you have done to solve any problems you face, or to\nsee the current 'status' of your project, such as your Design. Please\nthink how this will pay off in the future, as once you've set it down\nand had a thumbs-up from your Lab Tutor, you can rely upon that\ninformation as 'truth' and you don't need to puzzle over aspects of your\nstudy any further.\n\n**I promise, you can do this** Turn up, use your labs and independent\nstudy time wisely, and don't be afraid of making mistakes. Now is the\ntime to make mistakes, and if you DON'T make mistakes, you aren't doing\nit right!\n\n## Expectation management\n\nThe teaching team on the module are here because Psychological Research\nis one of our passions. We teach it to you because we know it to a\nhugely valuable skill, not just a programme requirement. We understand\nthat you might not immediately think it's going to be fun, or useful,\nbut we aren't going to continually try to coax you into activity. If\nnecessary, consider how the skills involved will be important for your\nfinal grade, for your future career path, or for your general\nintellectual development. Then throw yourself into it.\n\nThe bare minimum expectation is to attend Lectures and Labs, to engage\nwith the content, and to allocate independent study hours each and every\nweek. How many hours will be a decision you need to make for yourself,\nbut they are required EVERY week. This module is 25% of the year in\nterms of module weight, 29% of your year grade, and when combined with\nyour final year dissertation, research contributes 50% of your final\ngrade.\n\nIt is easy to get sidetracked with Essays during the course of the term.\nPlease consider that those essays contribute 15% of a 15 credit module.\nThe Critical Proposal is worth double that for starters, and your\nMini-Dissertation is worth 10X more than any individual essay.\nAllocating too much time to the 5 essays and falling behind on your\nMini-Dissertation is a really poor idea.\n\nMaterials on the VLE will be considered the 'baseline' and you should\nfamiliarise yourself with what is available there - it will be\neverything you need to do really well. We shall be offering 'extras' -\nresources that will support further exploration of a topic, developing\nfurther skills, or just interesting added-value content, you will find\nthis under 'DangerZone' - these are optional, and if you wish to add\nanything to these, or suggest some content, please let me know - always\nhappy to help!\n\nOn this site, resources may include short self-assessment quizzes.\nAnswers are NOT tracked, so use these to test your comprehension, or\nidentify areas for focus.\n\n> **Why quiz at all?** Research shows that giving small quizzes\n> throughout a class can dramatically help with *retention*. It's a\n> phenomenon known as the \"retrieval effect\" - basically, you have to\n> *practice* remembering things, otherwise your brain won't remember\n> them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the\n> book [\"Make It Stick: The Science of Successful\n> Learning,\"](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674729018)\n> by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel.\n\n## Teamwork\n\nI bet you just let out a sigh of disgust. Everyone does at the thought\nof working as a group. But... Do you know the first question on NHS\nClinical Doctorate reference requests? Or the first thing that employers\nusually ask for in Reference Request templates and questionnaires?\n\n\"To what extent is the applicant able to work as part of a team?\"\n\nI kid you not. And if you can't operate effectively in a team, we have\nto say so. It's a silly way to miss out on a job. View the process of\nteam work as something that you actively allocate time to. Develop a\nprocess. Communicate. Plan. Evaluate.\n\nIn this module, we suggest a process based in Software Development,\ncalled Scrum. There are many variants and nuances, but the key component\nis a Stand-Up meeting. We propose that you use the first 15 minutes of\nEVERY lab to run such a meeting. Each team member has 1-2 minutes (VERY\nSHORT) to cover 3 topics. 1- What did you do last week? 2 - What are you\ngoing to do in today's lab/this week? 3 - Do you anticipate any\nobstacles or problems?\n\nThis ensures accountability towards group goals, allows you to clearly\nidentify areas you need to focus on, and to be ready to ask your Lab\nTutor any questions that may obstruct your progress. Each week I will be\ngiving a set of reasonable objectives to help you work out where you\ncould/should be. These are obviously flexible, but you should look to\nmake forward progress each and every week.\n\nIf you choose to use an alternative system to manage your team or your\ntime, fine. But it cannot be replaced with nothing. Your Lab Tutor will\nbe asking to see your plans, and see how you may have allocated tasks or\nresponsibilities. It may sound like a burden, but this is what you will\nlikely have to do with your supervisor next year, and certainly you'll\nneed these skills in later life. It takes a few minutes a week, but\ncould save you DAYS!\n\n# Grades\n\n## Passing the module.\n\nEvery year a handful of people fail the module. This is usually because\nthey don't submit one of the three pieces of work. If you attend the\nlabs, and follow the suggested activities, you will pass. Simple as\nthat. If you submit an Ethics Application, collect data, analyse it\nusing a 2x2 ANOVA, and write up a complete APA format report, with\nsupplementary Open Materials and Open Data, you WILL pass. So the\nquestion is really...\n\n## How to improve your grade\n\nThe Mini-Dissertation has roughly 27 key moving parts. It's easy to deal\nwith them all over the course of 20 weeks. But by approaching each as an\nopportunity to draft, revise and refine, you will be continually\nbuilding marks. First drafts or incomplete elements get poor marks -\nsimple as that. Use the resources as a guide, don't miss anything out,\ngive yourself time. If anything is unclear, ask your Lab Tutor, or ask\nme. There are no hidden traps on this module. It's just do some research\nwithin the constraints described, and write it up in APA format.\n\n## Textbooks\n\nThe library reading list includes textbooks and resources with a\npreference for those that are freely available and online, either via\nthe library website, or cost-free on the internet. We shall be sharing\nlots of resources we have developed, and signposting other free\nresources. There really is NO NEED to pay for access to other materials\n(unless you want to), but there is usually no shortcut you can pay for.\nIf resources don't exist, ask for them.\n\nFinding a consistent textbook that you use and trust is highly\nrecommended - if in doubt have a poke around on the Library Reading list\nand find one you like. A consistent voice is better than just googling a\nquestion and hearing different takes from numerous different sources.\n\nI shall be signposting Open Educational Resources that have good take on\nany topic, and maybe even tailoring those resources to the year. Please\nconsider using `Hypothes.is` to track your resources, and to share them\nwith the group using the `PS52007D group`\n\n|                                                                         |                          |                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) | Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, Hardin | OpenIntro Inc., 1st Edition, 2021 |\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Course Information\n\n::: {style=\"width:600px\"}\n| Instructor                                                                                                 | Course                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| <i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> Dr. Gordon Wright                                                              | <i class=\"far fa-calendar\"></i> Lecture: Mondays         |\n| <i class=\"fas fa-university\"></i> Whitehead 200/1                                                          | <i class=\"fa fa-map-marker-alt\"></i> PSH LG02 10-11am    |\n| <i class=\"fas fa-talk\"></i> Office Hours: Monday Afternoon time TBC                                        | <i class=\"far fa-calendar-alt\"></i> Labs : Tuesdays      |\n| <i class=\"fas fa-envelope\"></i> [{{< var instructor.email >}}](mailto:%7B%7B%3C%20var%20email%20%3E%7D%7D) | <i class=\"far fa-clock\"></i> See your personal timetable |\n| <i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i> [\\@DrDeception](https://twitter.com/drdeception)                            |                                                          |\n:::\n\n# Attendance / class recording\n\nYou should plan to attend lectures and labs in person - attendance is\ntaken at all timetabled sessions!
