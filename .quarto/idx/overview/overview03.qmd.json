Please attend to how confident you\n    feel going from the 'page to the stage'. The jump from a written\n    methods section, to running a task yourself is somewhat daunting,\n    but you need to be able to anticipate any complexities up front.\n    Simply put, if you don't understand it, how are you going to do it?\n    By identifying elements you don't fully understand, you can enlist\n    the help of your Supervisor.\n\n-   If you are not wise enough to show your Target Paper to your Lab\n    Tutor, you are missing an opportunity for individual support.\n\n-   You are NOT expected to know everything or be able to fully identify\n    all problems, but you CAN identify what you don't know how to do,\n    and anything about the process that is unclear. You are required to\n    manage your Supervisor to help you learn and grow.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Week 03\n\n```{=html}\n\n<iframe src=\"https://ps52007d.littlemonkeylab.com/slides/week03/lecture.slides.html\" title=\"Week 03 Lecture\" width=\"960\" height=\"500\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n```\n## Introduction & Lecture Preview\n\n::: {.callout .primary}\n**Key Focus:** Critical Proposal - Due end of Week 5 Please make sure to\nread the detailed Coursework Briefing and Rubric.\n:::\n\n-   **Important Points:**\n    1.
