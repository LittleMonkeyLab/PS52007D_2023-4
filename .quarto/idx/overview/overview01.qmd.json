It's only Welcome Week. Give me a chance.\n\n-   In weeks to come, this will give you an idea of what you\n    could/should have done by now, and things you may wish to\n    prioritise.\n\n### Reflection and Meta-Cognitive Practice\n\n::: callout-tip\n**Suggested Reflection:** Think about Team Work you have done before.\nWhat did you enjoy? What were the problems you faced? How will you\naddress them this time?\n\n**Imagine describing how you operated as a team this year to a future\nsupervisor/employer. What would you want to say?**\n\nHere are some thoughts:\n\n#### Communication is Key\n\n-   Maintain open, honest, and respectful communication with your team\n    members. Good communication leads to seamless collaboration. Make it\n    as frictionless as possible. Maybe try something like Slack or Jira,\n    specifically for the project, so that you don't use it for anything\n    but the Mini-Diss. Slack and Jira are almost ubiquitous in modern\n    business, and by having a passing knowledge of them, or being able\n    to name drop them in an interview... boom.\n\n#### Define Roles and Responsibilities\n\n-   Clearly define what each team member is responsible for. This\n    eliminates confusion and ensures that everyone is accountable. If\n    you aren't going to deliver, communicate that fact to your team.\n\n#### Set Deadlines\n\n-   Establish realistic deadlines and stick to them. This fosters a\n    sense of urgency and helps you keep the project on track. The Weekly\n    Standup meeting is an ideal way to do this in a short, and slightly\n    longer term.\n\n#### Embrace Diversity\n\n-   Utilize the diverse skills, experiences, and perspectives within\n    your team to enrich your project. Diversity fosters creativity and\n    problem-solving. Some aspects of the project may be things that you\n    KNOW will be important for you next year... Take responsibility for\n    that and try it on for size.\n\n#### Conflict Resolution\n\n-   Conflicts are inevitable in any team setting. Address issues\n    directly but diplomatically, aiming for a resolution that benefits\n    the team as a whole. And if a team-member disappears... What are you\n    going to do?\n\n#### Reflect and Adapt\n\n-   After each major milestone, take some time to reflect on what worked\n    well and what didn't. Adapt your strategies accordingly for future\n    tasks. This might not be until next year, when it really counts, so\n    having these ideas to build on will be amazing.\n\n#### Document Everything (e.g. Lab Notebook)\n\n-   Keep records of conversations with your Lab Tutor, decisions you\n    made as a group and individually, and any changes you make along the\n    way. This will not only help you stay organized but will also be\n    useful for future reference, think of it as a love letter to future\n    you.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll not only deliver an exceptional\nMini-Dissertation but also gather compelling stories and examples to\nshare with future employers or a supervisor next year. When asked, \"How\nwould you work as part of a team\" you'll have a well-rounded, articulate\nanswer that demonstrates your team skills, problem-solving abilities,\nand commitment to achieving goals.\n:::\n\nIf you've made it this far, please help me assemble a furry research\ncheer-leading crew and email me a picture of your cat/dog/hamster or\nanything cute/amusing. And make sure you have your Signature in place.\nLet's have a great year!\n\n{{< fa thumbs-up >}}\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Week 01\n\n```{=html}\n\n<iframe src=\"https://ps52007d.littlemonkeylab.com/slides/week01/lecture.slides.html\" title=\"Week01 Lecture\" width=\"960\" height=\"500\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n```\n## Introduction & Lecture Preview\n\n::: {.callout .primary}\n**Key Focus:** Module Overview and getting started in the labs\n:::\n\n-   **Important Points:**\n    1.
