# Induction Overview

## Welcome back and welcome to Research Methods!

here is some content

## This year you become Scientists!

This year, in Research Methods, you will perform your first piece of
REAL psychological research

In groups, you will:

::: small
-   Identify an area of psychological research
-   Review and critique the literature in this area
-   Develop a testable hypothesis
-   Design a 2x2 ANOVA experiment unique to you (within your group
    design)
-   Obtain Ethical Approval for your experiment
-   Collect REAL data
-   Analyse these data
-   Write up the results in APA format
:::

## A full overview will be given in the first lecture!

Do not worry! It's going to be a great adventure!

## A 'warm up' for your Y3 Dissertation

::: small
-   The same 20-week timeline
-   The same skills and techniques you will need
-   Careful step-by-step guidance and support in the lab setting
-   Scaled-down experiments and write-ups
-   The security of working in a group
-   Tips and advice from world-class researchers
-   Opportunity to think carefully about your final year Dissertation,
    and how to crush it!!
:::

## Support and guidance

-   Gordon Wright (Module Coordinator and floating Enthusiast in Chief)
-   7 gobsmackingly amazing Lab Tutors
-   Your Personal Tutor and your PT group
-   AND EACH OTHER!!

This is a team-sport

## me

I will be in every Research Methods lecture and I have a Student Hour
from 3-4 every Monday, before we all go to the Design & Analysis
lecture. Yup! Me too!

Available at g.wright\@gold.ac.uk

I genuinely could not imagine anything I would rather do than this.
Please talk to me! Help me get to know you!

## Module weighting and assessment

Research Methods is a core module with a 30 credit weighting

This means that in order to progress to Y3, you must pass all 3
assessment elements:

-   ::: takeaway
    -   Critical Proposal 1,800 words (15%)

    -   Mini-Dissertation 2,500 words (70%)

    -   CHIP Learning Log 1,200 words (15%)
    :::

## A friendly warning

::: callout-warning
## Warning

All coursework is [INDIVIDUAL]{.shout} and subject to normal plagiarism
and collusion rules
:::

## Module structure

1 x 1 hr Lecture per week (Monday)

1 x 2 hr Lab per week (Tuesday)

4 x Personal Tutor meetings across the year

## Weekly Structure

Each week there will be a very brief '**Preparation**' designed to
introduce the main topics of the week

**Lecture** (slides a week ahead and recording posted afterwards)

**Labs**

-   Broad structure, but for you to use to advantage
-   Attendance QR code up for 15 minutes, and the first 15 minutes is
    for you to get yourself sorted out as a group
-   Your Lab Tutor will give a 10-15 minute overview of what you could
    be doing, and a survey of the resources/materials provided
-   If you need support, make yourself known as your Lab Tutor (or I)
    tour the lab(s)
-   You can (and should) ask any questions that occur to you. The labs
    are for this purpose. Your Lab Tutor will not be responding to
    emails outside of lab sessions
-   Lots can be achieved in the labs, but independent study and
    coordinated group work will be required

[NO EXAM]{.shout}

## Coursework

The courseworks ALL require critical reflection and metacognitive
practice. This will be discussed in a number of lectures, but it
contributes to effective learning and your integration of the skills and
experience of doing this research exercise.

## Time management and teamwork

..will both be required.

I ask you to see both as an opportunity to develop these important
skills.

You will see we have some ideas to make this more relevant to careers
and employability

It is easier to 'keep up than to catch up'.

## Resources

We will be releasing a series of valuable resources to help you through
every step of the process

These will have value for your final year dissertation too.

Contribution to and comment on these is welcome and hoped for!

Open Educational Resources will be used extensively, and most core
readings are available online via the library.

# Thank you

## Thank you for your time

And have an amazing year!

The Research Methods Team
