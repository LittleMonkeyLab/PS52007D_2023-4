## Introduction & Lecture Preview

::: {.callout .primary}
**Key Focus:** Module Overview and getting started in the labs
:::

-   **Important Points:**
    1.  Read Learning Outcomes
    2.  Read Coursework information and scan available resources
        (Marking Rubrics, Critical Proposal Brief, Mini-Dissertation
        Templates/examples).
-   **Preparatory Reading or Thinking:**
    -   \[Prep 1\] Think about potential topics and/or methods that
        excite you for your Mini-Dissertation
    -   \[Prep 2\] Consider how you are going to work, and with whom.
        You will be keeping detailed notes and communicating regularly.
        How will you want to manage that?
    -   \[Prep 3\] Think about your timetable and deadlines. When are
        you going to do your regular independent study. Where will you
        do it? With whom?
