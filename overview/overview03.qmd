## Introduction & Lecture Preview

::: {.callout .primary}
**Key Focus:** Critical Proposal - Due end of Week 5 Please make sure to
read the detailed Coursework Briefing and Rubric.
:::

-   **Important Points:**
    1.  Choosing a good paper is part of the assessment

    2.  If in doubt, the focus should be on Methods and Materials

    3.  You are REQUIRED to include an effect size, and this needs to be
        included in the Design Schematic which can be downloaded in the
        Coursework Information section of the VLE and edited at
        www.draw.io

-   **Preparatory Reading or Thinking:**
    -   Please refer to any general textbooks, or the resources by
        Barber in the Reading List

## Primary Thought

-   Get your 'Target Paper' on screen and see what your Lab Tutor
    thinks. Get them to verify that it is an empirical paper from a
    relevant journal and has a Methods section that will allow you to
    meet the brief.

### Main Lab Activities

-   **Make sure to complete your name in the Miro Board (in your group
    if possible).**
-   Follow the worksheet guidance on identifying relevant critique for
    your Target Paper

### Module Milestones (by end of this week)

-   Have identified a candidate Target Paper and started jotting down
    potential critique and ideas for how to build upon it.
-   Show the paper to your Lab Tutor and get a confidence-boosting
    thumbs-up.

### Reflection and Meta-Cognitive Practice

-   You will be performing this exact exercise (potentially a few times)
    for your Final Year Dissertation. Please attend to how confident you
    feel going from the 'page to the stage'. The jump from a written
    methods section, to running a task yourself is somewhat daunting,
    but you need to be able to anticipate any complexities up front.
    Simply put, if you don't understand it, how are you going to do it?
    By identifying elements you don't fully understand, you can enlist
    the help of your Supervisor.

-   If you are not wise enough to show your Target Paper to your Lab
    Tutor, you are missing an opportunity for individual support.

-   You are NOT expected to know everything or be able to fully identify
    all problems, but you CAN identify what you don't know how to do,
    and anything about the process that is unclear. You are required to
    manage your Supervisor to help you learn and grow.
