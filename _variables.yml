    E-mail is the best ways to get in contact with me. I will try to respond to all course-related e-mails within 24 hours. Any questions relating to the course, coursework or anything not personal/confidential in nature should be submitted to the Course Forum. This benefits all students. So, if you email me about the course, don't be surprised if you get a brief 'Please post this to the Forum' message!   Office hours are advertised on the module VLE page.
