# Here is some stuff

enjoy the shit out of it.

# A possible timeline for the Mini-Dissertation {.mdtimeline}

## Week 1

The aim for today is to brainstorm some areas of research that might be
of interest to you. You might be motivated to just work with your
buddies. Or you might want to work with people from your PT group who
share a similar interest.

Work out how you wish to work. This is the last large-scale piece of
group work you'll do prior to getting a reference.

Start thinking about how you can search for literature on the topic you
have chosen.

What methods are used? What is feasible? What would you like to learn
about?
