## A VERY simple worksheet this week

Have a look at the Open Science Foundation website

If you have a topic in mind, have a peek for any repositories relevant
to that topic.

Have a look for `Open Materials` and `Open Data`

[OSF \| When Research is Mesearch: How Researchers' Motivation to Pursue
a Topic Affects Laypeople's Trust in Science](https://osf.io/phfq3/)
[https://osf.io/phfq3/](http://127.0.0.1:26677/#0 "https://osf.io/phfq3/")

## Keep working on your Critical Proposals

If you have checked your target paper with your Lab Tutor.. Great.

If not, do so. Use the Materials in the Coursework Information section
of the VLE to scaffold your reading and re-reading of the paper. Apply
some careful thought. Discuss!

## Next week we will discuss Open Science

In your mini-dissertation submissions, you are required to submit both
`Open Materials` and `Open Data`

Some of you will not bother, or not remember. You cannot get a first if
you omit these elements.

## Find the mainstream, for now...

It is perfectly normal if you are trying to find solid ground with
regards to how your topic is researched. Finding the 'mainstream' is the
right point to be at.

Think about any names that keep cropping up. Look at whether techniques
are consistent. Use tools from the Library or ResearchRabbit.ai to
identify network effects or citation patterns.

Very shortly, once you've seen the mainstream, the humdrum, the middle
of the road, you may start to see the rebels, the disruptors, the
innovators, the people that Steve Jobs called 'The Crazy Ones, the
MisFits' - the ones you can't ignore

## Are you going to be a troublemaker?

I'll be disappointed if you're not!

## Have a great week and keep cracking on.
