## A question for you.

How many journal articles are you able/willing to read for your
Personality Essay?

Let's say 5 is your answer. (of course, you need to be the judge of what
the right answer is, but I'd wager 5 is likely in the low end of the
range)

Strategy 1 - Read the first 5 papers that turn up on Google when you
type in `Academic Success`?

Strategy 2 - Read the first 5 papers that turn up on the Library search
when you type in `Academic Success`?

Which is better, Strategy 1 or Strategy 2?

Maybe neither 1 nor 2 is necessarily optimal... What might be a better
approach?

Strategy is important though. You want to be strategic. You want a
'Search Strategy'

Some key considerations are:

Where you search and what tools you use

What you search for (your search terms)

What types of papers you are going to look for

How you handle the intial results

How you refine those results and decide that the search is over

How you read and ingest those results

How you take notes and focus on all the areas you need to to answer the
question

## Here is something you may find useful

I'm presenting this early, as I think it is a powerful
'thought-provoker'. Last year, a student gave me a box of chocolates for
sharing this. I kid you not. When we talk about being strategic and
organised in your research, this is the sort of thing we are thinking
about.

This is a 'Reading Tracker' [Excel Reading
Tracker](https://goldsmithscollege-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/gwrig002_campus_goldsmiths_ac_uk/ETkOn8pGKKVIpsk-4cf3XOYBya07TmUCkl_88ZANGpgxNQ?e=sfn4lx)

It may not be entirely to your taste, but feel free to develop your own
version. Consider how a few minutes of organisation may allow you to
make more of the same preparation, or to help you identify gaps you need
to explore, or areas you've done enough work on trying to document. You
are welcome.

## The Library.

This is what they do. Use their expertise.

Library resources which you may or may not be familiar with

<https://libguides.gold.ac.uk/psychology/databases>

But the following video is excellent and outlines most of the major
resources and steps you'll need to be very successful.

<https://youtu.be/g_Eq-pDQ7c8>

## Google and Google Scholar

You don\'t KNOW that you have access to the papers Google or Google
Scholar points to, and you don\'t know what the algorithm is doing to
point you there. Do you think it knows how to find the best science?

Use this FAQ to set up the Findit\@Gold tool in Google Scholar, which
takes you DIRECTLY to a resource in the Goldsmiths Library, to which you
usually have access!

<https://libanswers.gold.ac.uk/faq/53426>

## Advanced search techniques 

You will also notice that there are lots of useful tools available
beyond the keyword searches and Boolean operators (not sure? See the
library guide).

<https://libguides.gold.ac.uk/aso/library/advancedsearch#s-lg-box-wrapper-17019261>

\
Perform a search in the library and try some of the MANY filters and
tools.

Try the Advanced Search options such as Boolean Search. This is
increasingly a life-skill. Many search functions, whether academic or
websites or document stores (e.g. Corporate Knowledge-bases) use boolean
search.

# Browzine

Browsing by journal title can be very useful. It's great on your phone.

Give it a shot and look at Annual Reviews of Psychology.

![](images/Annual Review.png)

I always recommend Annual Reviews of Psychology for Review articles on
the major topic areas you probably have in mind at the moment.

Use the link below or access the journal via the library.

<https://browzine.com/libraries/1374/subjects/67/bookcases/169/bookshelves/1230?sort=title>

## And if we don't have access via the Library

<https://openaccessbutton.org/>

<https://unpaywall.org/>

And I have already mentioned [Senate House
Library](https://catalogue.libraries.london.ac.uk/search~S1/) - it has
an incredible catalogue and is free to you to use. Could be handy in a
pinch!

You could also consider an `Inter-Library Loan`. It\'s free, but can
take a few days. Be prepared and this essentially gives you access to
pretty much anything you might need or want. Find the [request form
here](https://librarysearch2.gold.ac.uk/client/en_GB/goldsmiths/requests?&)
and fill in as much information as you can.

# Web of Science

My preferred database is Web of Science. It is comprehensive, but
sometimes gives too many results and can be overwhelming. Always try to
use some of the advanced tools to limit your options.

<https://libguides.gold.ac.uk/az.php?a=w>

I particularly like the Forward search and Backward searches. You can
look for papers that cite the article you found (Forward search) or find
the papers that it references (Backward search). Why might that be
useful?

25 References should be clear - the paper includes 25 references in the
reference list.

14 Citations means that 14 other papers or books are referenced this
paper. What a cool way to find a strand of research where potentially
similar methods are used, OR where results/methods are criticised or
discussed!

## These are just tools. They are not going to be the full answer

The most important thing is to **BE ORGANISED AND STRATEGIC** with your
searching and reading. Having 20 papers downloaded but unread is not as
good as reading 1 [*really well*]{.underline} and somehow keeping track
of the important information gleaned from it. **How are you going to do
that?**

Some of you might ask \"How many papers should I read or reference in my
Mini-Dissertation?\" How could we answer that questions?

The point is that you will read a number, and part of the success of the
process is keeping that number manageable, and using the information
well. Some of you might make the mistake of reading too few, many of you
will read too many. Reflect on this part of the process this year.

## Zotero

You will almost certainly read more for Final Year Dissertation than for
any other piece of coursework. This can lead to challenges. But you
might actually really enjoy it! But the same rule applies. **BE
ORGANISED AND STRATEGIC.**

A number of students have extolled the virtues of Zotero, which is a
reference management app that is free from the library
<https://www.gold.ac.uk/it/apps/zotero/>

It\'s not important to get too complicated right now, but being good at
tracking what you read is a useful skill for next year. Maybe give
Zotero a shot. See whether it would help you next year, it\'s just a
fancy version of the excel workbook I made. The library has videos that
can help prepare you for next year. But you could try it now and be one
step ahead. That\'s what the Mini-Dissertation is here for, to give you
a safe environment to try out all aspects of the research process. Â

## An Artificial Intelligence Research Assistant??

I suggest exploring what AI might offer to this process. I have tried
lots of these resources, but by far and away the best I have found is
<https://www.researchrabbit.ai>- and it's free.

You can link it to your Zotero account and find the whole network of
associated papers, authors, topics laid out in front of you. If you
prefer visual information, this is for you!
