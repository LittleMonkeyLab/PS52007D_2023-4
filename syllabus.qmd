# Remote attendance / class recording

You should plan to attend class in person. I will only open a zoom for
virtual attendance on an individual case-by-case basis for specific
excusable absences (e.g. illness, family matters, etc.). Lectures will
**not** be recorded. In-person attendance is critical as we will spend a
lot of time working on problems and writing code during class. If you
have any questions or need special accommodations, send me a message on
slack and we can discuss.

# Course Description

## GW Bulletin Description (short)

Introduction to exploratory data analysis using the [R programming
language](https://www.r-project.org/); data visualization, data
cleaning, exploratory analysis, information communication, rmarkdown,
reproducibility.

# Pep Talk!

Working in and learning a programming language can be as challenging as
learning a new spoken language. Hadley Wickham (chief data scientist at
RStudio and author of many amazing R packages you'll be using) [made
this wise
observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):

> It's easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and
> think, "Oh it's me, I'm really stupid," or, "I'm not made out to
> program." But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets
> frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code.
> It's just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone
> and gets less and less over time. Don't blame yourself. Just take a
> break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

If you're finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against
a wall and not understanding, **take a break**, talk to classmates, ask
questions in Slack, and try it again later.

**I promise, you can do this**

## Quizzes

There will be 5 quizzes given about once every other week immediately at
the beginning of class. You will not be told in advance when there is a
quiz, and make up quizzes will not be available if you miss it (except
for excused absences). Please show up on time to class each week to
ensure that you do not miss a quiz.

Quizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and
assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz. Quizzes are
**short** (5-10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to
demonstrate where additional study is needed. **Quizzes are
low-stakes** - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small
portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as
feedback on where you need additional improvement.

> **Why quiz at all?** Research shows that giving small quizzes
> throughout a class can dramatically help with *retention*. It's a
> phenomenon known as the "retrieval effect" - basically, you have to
> *practice* remembering things, otherwise your brain won't remember
> them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the
> book ["Make It Stick: The Science of Successful
> Learning,"](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674729018)
> by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel.

## Homework

Students will be responsible for two types of assignments throughout the
semester:

-   **Weekly Assignments**: Each week, students will be assigned
    specific readings and exercises to prepare for the next class
    period. Students will need to submit responses that include a
    thoughtful reflection on these concepts each week.
-   **Mini Projects**: There will be three mini projects throughout the
    semester designed to provide hands-on experience with the material
    covered in class by working with and exploring real data sets and /
    or creating visualizations. While students may work with their peers
    on these assignments, each student must submit their own work.
    Credit for each assignment will be allocated according to a rubric
    provided in the assignment description.

## Final Project

Throughout the semester, students will work in teams of 2-3 students
towards a final project of an exploratory data analysis. At the end of
the semester, each student will submit a report of their analysis in the
form of an html web page and create a 5 to 10-minute video presentation
of their results. To make the overall project more manageable, it will
be broken down into several separate "milestone" deliverables due
throughout the semester, including a proposal, progress report,
presentation video, and final report.

View the [final project overview](project-final/0-overview.qmd) page for
more details.

## Final Interview

Rather than have a final exam, each student will have a 10-minute
interview by the instructor. The interview will be focused on the final
project the student worked and will contain questions related to
concepts covered during the course. Students will be provided a list of
questions and the grading rubric ahead of the interview.

# Grading

## Category Breakdown

Final grades will be calculated as follows:
