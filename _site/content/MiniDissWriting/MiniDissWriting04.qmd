# Open Data

## Open Data requirements

Open Data is the concept of making research data accessible to everyone,
promoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research -
all critical features of an Open Science. In the field of psychology,
sharing data is crucial for advancing scientific knowledge. This guide
will provide step-by-step instructions for creating an Open Data
submission for a psychology research project such as the
Mini-Dissertation (and your Final Year Dissertations for that matter!).

::: callout-important
## Important

It is a compulsory that you submit your data. If you do not submit
something, then your submission is not complete and the mark awarded
will be impacted.

By taking the time to produce a clear Open Data submission, you will
enhance the overall quality of your submission, and this will be
reflected in your mark.
:::

1.  Prepare your data: Before submitting your data, ensure that it is
    well-organized, accurate, and complete. You might be fixated on
    doing the analysis, but in many ways, the way you treat and
    pre-process your data (prepare it for the analysis) is [even
    more]{.underline} critical to reliable results.

2.  This includes:

    a\. Cleaning and validating the data: Remove any errors,
    inconsistencies, or missing values. This may be down to participant
    error or a result of anything you might have done in this, your
    first data collection exercise (mistakes are to be EXPECTED! Don't
    hide them!). Make sure the data is properly formatted (an example
    here might be consistent decimal places, or labelling in your
    variable headers.

    b\. Anonymizing the data: To protect participants' privacy, remove
    any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names,
    addresses, or user generated codes. Replace these with unique
    identifiers, if necessary. This can be as simple as a number from
    1 - n (where n is your total sample size).

3.  Create a data dictionary or codebook: A data dictionary is a simple
    document that describes the variables in your dataset, their
    definitions, units of measurement, and any coding schemes used, such
    as values for any categorised data e.g. gender (1 = female, 2 =
    male, 3 = prefer not to say).

    This will help others understand and use your data more effectively.
    Consider including the following information for each variable:

    a.  Variable name as it exists in your dataset
    b.  Variable description - what is the variable? Score on what
        measure of your Open Materials?
    c.  Data type (e.g., categorical, continuous, binary)
    d.  Units of measurement (if applicable, milliseconds, hours per
        day)
    e.  Consider count information, or summary information (mean, range
        etc)
    f.  Coding scheme (if applicable, 1 = strongly disagree, 2 =
        disagree etc.)

4.  Information on any pre-processing you performed:

    What were your decision rules on missing data or participant
    exclusion? Your data set can be the original data set which includes
    data you later do not analyse, or the data set that had undergone
    pre-processing and had had all the missing values removed... in
    either case, I want to know the process involved, so that I will be
    able to do it if I try to replicate your analysis!

5.  Choose a suitable format (or formats) for submission: In real
    research, you could host this on OSF.io or a similar data
    repository, but you are going to submit it as a supplementary file.
    Choose a format (or formats) that are usable. Ideally, I would like
    to be able to import your data directly, so it should be in a .csv,
    .xlsx, or .sav file, but Jamovi, R or equivalent is fine too.

    Any descriptive content (such as 3 or 4) could be in a pdf and
    submitted alongside the Mini-Dissertation (you can submit up to 5
    files)

By following these guidelines, you will contribute to a more transparent
and collaborative research environment in the field of psychology,
ultimately promoting the advancement of scientific knowledge.

## Analysing your data starts here... with good set up! {#sec-analysing-your-data-starts-here...}

I know that you have used SPSS plenty already, but it is normally the
case that you've only worked on downloaded pre-existing data sets, or
followed step-by-step guides as a class. This time, these are YOUR data,
of which you should be proud! Nobody has ever seen these data before.

[Examples of the 3 flavours of dataset can be found on the
VLE.](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/folder/view.php?id=1448200)

For your Mini-Dissertations you are going through all the stages of a
research project, from idea origination, through to the final
presentation of the report. One of the parts that often (unnecessarily)
causes anxiety is the analysis. Don't let it! You'll get lots of help in
the labs after Reading Week!

It is important that you go about the process of data preparation and
analysis methodically and with care. You've worked hard to generate
these data, give them the attention they deserve. And at the end of the
process... you get to see what happened in your experiment.

This worksheet will offer you tools to start off well. I don't doubt
that you will have an occasional mishap, but that is how we learn and
improve. And I still google things sometimes!

Remember, the mini-dissertation is carefully constrained to a 2x2
design, but by using this as a case-study, we can equip you with all the
skills necessary for something more exotic next year.

When you open SPSS, you'll see the familiar Data Editor screen. Let me
point a few things out.

![](images/image-416753022.png){width="300"}

![](images/image-1643419274.png) Open data document. This is where you
can navigate to open your data set. Obvious, I know.

![](images/image-1272547429.png) This button saves your data set. Use
this regularly. And save your data set in the cloud. You do not want to
have to redo data preparation. And use version control. If you spend
time on a data set and reach the end of a session, save it with the date
and start the next session with a copy. I dearly hope you listen to
this, and don't learn the hard way.

![](images/image-1667930257.png) Recently used dialogues. Allows you to
pick from a dropdown menu of operations you have performed previously.
Most people don't get to know this button exists and spend hours
clicking through the menus. Using this button is the easiest way to do
what you did last time, but make a slight modification (e.g. you forgot
to select something).

![](images/image-241978957.png) Most things that you do in the data
editor window can be undone and redone. Anything that can't be undone
will give you a warning window. If you are going to try stuff out, use a
copy of your dataset and keep a safe copy of the last one you were
working on -- see Save button above.

![](images/image-480798691.png) Flip between Value labels. You'll see
how this can be helpful later on. Just pointing it out for now.

![](images/image-1370272646.png){width="150"} Sometimes you want to look
at your data (the numbers) and sometimes you want to look at what the
data are (labels and types of variables). `Data View` lets you look at
the numbers. Variable View lets you look at the labels and types of
variables in your data. Let's look at Variable View now.

Now that you are reminded of those, let's get things ready for when your
data are ready.

## Data input {#sec-data-input}

It may seem supremely dull, but properly formatting and labelling your
data is important. Remember that you will be uploading a dataset as part
of your submission under Open Data. It is important that an outsider can
understand your dataset and use it to reproduce your analysis, should
they wish.

![](images/image-128904341.png){width="150" height="20"} We use the
**`Variable View`** in SPSS to add and define the variables used in our
study. Each row represents one of your variables. Here, we can give them
sensible names and specify the type of data we are entering for each
one.

So start by thinking about **`Name`.** A variable name should be easy to
understand and informative. You can't use spaces or symbols, so you
should think about using underscores or hyphens
to-make-things_easier_to_understand.

**`Type`** specifies the type of data that is contained in that
variable.

When inputting your data, you will likely mostly use **`Numeric`,**
which simply means it mostly numbers. It could be scores on a test, or
categories which might be relevant for gender or group membership
(`1=Female, 2= Male, 3= Prefer not to say`, etc)

![](images/image-1770594430.png)

**`Width`** refers to the maximum number of characters in a given
variable. I don't think I've ever changed this from 8.

**`Decimals`** allows you to specify if a value shows decimal places or
not. I've used 0 in some screengrabs below, so that decimal places are
not shown, and 2 decimal places in others. I would suggest sticking with
the default of 2, unless you are using very precise measurements.

**`Label`** is VERY handy. It doesn't have the restrictions of `Name`,
and so you can give a variable a really clear informative label. And it
shows up in the output, meaning that the output is more easily
understood. Do take the time to use this field, as once you step away
from a dataset for even a couple of hours, it's possible to forget what
a variable is or represents.

![](images/image-1725533457.png)

`Value` is particularly useful for categorical variables (or nominal,
named variables as SPSS prefers). Assign every group a name and SPSS
will attach that name to the output too. It's easier to compare output
with the labels 'Females' and 'Males' than '1' and '2'.

![](images/image-533925408.png)

Enter the numeric value for your group, enter the label and click 'add'
and your label will be stored.

**`Measure`** allows you to specify the measurement type for a variable,
and sometimes this allows SPSS to deal with the data more accurately, so
it is important.

![](images/image-238199022.png){width="100"}

Use **`Scale`** if you are entering interval or ration data (i.e. where
the difference between scores on the scale is meaningful and
standardised; and intervals across the scale are equal) such as response
times or accuracy rates.

**`Ordinal`** if you have a categorical variable where the order of the
categories matter, such as Lickert Scales,

and **`Nominal`** if you have a categorical variable where the order of
categories does not matter.

You can also further classify your data according to **`Role`** , but
this is not crucial.

![](images/image-1428006537.png){width="100"}

**`Input`.** The variable will be used as an input (e.g., predictor,
independent variable).

**`Target`.** The variable will be used as an output or target (e.g.,
dependent variable).

**`Both`.** The variable will be used as both input and output. This is
the case with some aspects of the 2x2 design, but don't get caught up
with this.

**`None`.** The variable has no role assignment.

**`Partition`.** The variable will be used to partition the data into
separate samples for training, testing, and validation. Or if you will
exclude some participants based on the value.

**`Split`.** Is used for advanced functions I won't go into here.

## Inputting your data for the various 2x2 designs. {#sec-inputting-your-data-for-the-various-2x2-designs.}

In this series of toy examples, I'm running an experiment examining the
effect of Puzzle Difficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and
Background Music (IV2 with 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in
Seconds).

You will see that I couldn't quite make up my mind on what the optimal
2x2 design was for this study, and so we can try it in all 3 'flavours'
of 2x2 or two-way ANOVA

-   Independent (or between-groups) ANOVA

-   Repeated Measures (paired samples or within-participant) ANOVA

-   Mixed ANOVA

For each design, I'll include a participant ID number (which is good
practice) and I shall show the **Data View** with **numeric values** on
the left and with the **variable labels** on the right.

![](images/image-514939274.png) This button toggles between the two and
allows you to quickly see what you are working with.

I'll then show you the **`Variable View`** , so that you can see how
they are set up.

If you know what your specific design is, you can jump to that section
below, but I recommend you take the time to think about how data are
organised for all of the 3 'flavours', as this will be useful next year.

::: callout-tip
## Tip: Syntax

Even though your dataset may not yet be complete, you can dry-run the
analysis, and then re-run it using 'Syntax'. Simply put, syntax is the
code that runs the SPSS analysis behind the scenes.

This is something you could ask about in the labs if you are interested.
It's not something we usually teach.
:::

## 2x2 Independent (between-groups) ANOVA {#sec-2x2ind}

> In an independent ANOVA, each participant belongs in only one
> condition or cell in your 2x2 design grid, meaning that they are
> allocated to only one condition for each of your IVs out of the
> possible 4.

So in the example of my experiment examining the effect of Puzzle
Difficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and Background Music (IV2
with 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in Seconds), I would
randomly allocate people to solve one puzzle ONLY after informed
consent. So there are four conditions and a participant in my study will
only do one of them.

An easy puzzle with slow background music, an easy puzzle with fast
background music, a difficult puzzle with slow background music or a
difficult puzzle with fast background music.

You need to label the condition each participant was in for each of your
IVs separately so that SPSS knows what puzzle condition they got and
what music condition they got.

As always, each row corresponds to a single participant.

In this example, I've called Puzzle Difficulty **`IV1Difficulty`** so
that you can replace this in your mind with your first IV. I've used the
**`Label`** and **`Values`** to identify Easy puzzle group with 1 and
the difficult puzzle group with 2. **`IV2MusicSpeed`** uses 1 to signify
the Slow music condition and 2 to signify the Fast music condition

The first panel shows this in data view with **`numeric values`** , the
right panel with **`value labels`**. The **`Variable View`** shows how I
set this up.

The DV in my study is `DVSolveTime` and is how many seconds it took to
solve the puzzle.

## 2x2 Repeated Measures ANOVA {#sec-2x2RM}

> In a repeated measures ANOVA, each participant does all four
> conditions or cells in your 2x2 design grid. They would have been
> given all four conditions from a possible four.

So, in the example of my experiment examining the effect of Puzzle
Difficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and Background Music (IV2
with 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in Seconds), I would
randomly sequence the puzzles and music, but a participant in my study
would solve four puzzles making up all the possible combinations of
difficulty and music. In short, both levels of both of my IVs.

Every participant would have solved an easy puzzle with slow background
music, an easy puzzle with fast background music, a difficult puzzle
with slow background music and a difficult puzzle with fast background
music. Busy day!

In the previous example, we had one DV measure and needed to tell SPSS
which condition the participant was in. In this example, we have 4
measures of the DV (how long it took to solve each puzzle) so we need to
let SPSS see which response time corresponds to each condition.

As always, each row corresponds to a single participant.

In a repeated measures ANOVA setup, we don't need to use numbered groups
or labels, instead we rely on using **`Name`** in **`Variable View`** to
identify each of the 4 conditions the participant experienced. So this
is one of the simplest data sets.

## 2x2 Mixed ANOVA {#sec-2x2Mixed}

As you know, a repeated-measures ANOVA contains only
**within-participant** variables (where participants take part in *all*
conditions).

An independent ANOVA uses only **between-group** variables (where
participants only take part in one condition),

> A mixed ANOVA contains **BOTH** variable types. In this case, one of
> each. You will necessarily have one within-participant IV and one
> between-group IV.

In this last toy example using the puzzle music experiment, I decided
that participants were allocated to **either** the Easy or the Difficult
Puzzle condition (puzzle difficulty is the between-group IV with 2
levels)

Each participant then did two puzzles with both of the levels of the
Background Music condition, one puzzle with Slow background music, and
one puzzle with Fast background music (music is the within-participant
IV with 2 levels).

As always, each row corresponds to a single participant.

In this case, each participant solved 2 puzzles and so needs two
measures, but we need to identify the condition of the between-group IV
that they were in Easy Puzzles or Difficult Puzzles.

## Some useful calculations in SPSS {#sec-some-useful-calculations-in-spss}

Sometimes your data is not yet entirely ready for analysis and you need
to calculate a value to make your data make sense or to permit further
analysis. I shall present two useful calculations here.

It might be that you need to sum all the questions in a questionnaire to
get a grand total. Or you need to find the average score on a group of
questions or trials in an experiment.

I shall use that last example, **calculating a mean score** on a set of
trials, to illustrate this functionality, but you can do lots of useful
things the same way, simply by inserting variables in the SPSS dataset
into a calculation.

Another thing that many of you may need to do is to perform a **median
split** , where you take a continuous variable such as a score on a
personality measure and 'cut it in half' so that 50% of your sample is
considered low, and 50% is considered high.

So here's an experiment that needs me to do both of these things.

It's a 2x2 Mixed design experiment I ran recently, with 16 individuals
in my dataset.

I have allocated each participant a unique ID number, and I have age and
gender as demographic characteristics.

I have a variable to confirm their having given Informed Consent, and at
this point I have already removed any identifying information, and so
this is anonymous.

Participants completed a Psychopathy Questionnaire (The Triarchic
Psychopathy Measure -- TriPM) giving me a possible score of between 0
and 174 for each participant. I shall return to this measure when
talking about SPSS Scoring Syntax and Syntax more generally.

They then took part in a decision-making task, where they responded to
choices in 2 different scenarios. In one scenario they would be rewarded
as part of a team, in another they would be rewarded individually. They
each responded to two trials in each of the two conditions
(within-subject IV with 2 levels - manipulation of reward type: team
reward or individual reward).

Reaction Time was recorded for each trial to indicate how quickly the
participant made the decision.

Below is a snapshot of the Variable View and Data View. You'll see that
I need to complete the Median Split variable, and the two mean scores
variables at the right hand side.

## Performing a Median Split in SPSS {#sec-performing-a-median-split-in-spss}

Performing a median split allows you to categorise participants into
discreet groups based on a continuous variable. You turn a continuous
variable into a dichotomous variable (low & high, for example). The
median is used because it is the number at which point 50% of values lie
above, and 50% lie below. This means that usually, you get a nice equal
sample size in both groups.

The median split procedure is sometimes better than using a cut off
score or threshold, as a median split uses the data that you have in
hand, and doesn't assume anything about the sample of scores that you
have.

I want to categorise my 16 participants into 'LowPsychopathy' and
'HighPsychopathy' groups of equal size (hopefully) using a **median
split** procedure (essentially turning this into a quasi-experimental
between-group IV with 2 levels).

I could just work out the median with descriptive statistics, and then
by hand label each person as lower than the median or higher than the
median. With 16 participants, it might be quicker to do it that way, but
with more it would be very dull indeed and I'd probably still get mixed
up and make a mistake. So, I want to find a way to do it automatically
and accurately.

Here is the step-by-step procedure.

Go to the **`Transform`** menu and select **`Visual Binning`**

![](images/image-13544354.png){width="200"}

Simply put, this allows you to put participants into 'bins' based on a
set of rules you make.

Select the variable you are going to use to divide people up. In this
case, I choose the total score for my TriPM Psychopathy measure
(`TotalScoreTriPm`), move it into the **`Variables to Bin`** field and
click **`continue`**.

![](images/image-1092678164.png)

I'm then presented with this view of the distribution of the data.

![](images/image-886603242.png)

So we want to find the median, or the point at which we cut the data in
half. We click the **`Make Cutpoints`** button.

In the section marked **`Equal percentiles based on scanned`**`cases`
**we input 1 in the** `number of cutpoints` **box and it automagically
fills** 50% **in the** width **box. Click** `Apply`

![](images/image-1289870961.png)

Think about that. We asked SPSS to cut our variable into equal groups
based on observed data with a single chop! It could only ever be at the
Median! It's a funny set of commands, but makes sense, right?

If we asked for 2 cutpoints, it would give Low, Medium and High groups
cut at 33.33% and 66.66%. Two cuts with equal numbers on each side = 3
groups -- a tertile split or trichotomized variable. But I digress.

Now just label your new variable in the **`Binned Variable`** box and
label the values.

You'll notice that for the data I used, the value is up to and including
54 as low and anything over 54 is considered high. Bearing in mind the
scale goes up to 174, and cutoff are usually much higher than 54, the
median split is better for my data than that cutoff. There wouldn't be
ANYBODY in the high group.

![](images/image-1118506612.png)

When you click on `OK`, it pops a new variable at the end of the data
set with the information you need (highlighted in blue below). From
here, I would move that variable to it's rightful place in my dataset,
or copy and paste the values into the relevant column if I had already
set it up. Alternatively, I could have given it exactly the same name in
the **`Binned Variable`** label setting and it would have replaced the
empty cells. But I wanted you to see that new variables usually pop to
the far end of the data set.

![](images/image-1710620886.png)

## Calculating a mean score variable {#sec-calculating-a-mean-score-variable}

Now to calculate the mean score across a series of variables. In this
instance, I want to calculate the mean response time for decisions in
the two individual reward trials, so that for each participant I have a
mean response time across all trials of that type.

![](images/image-379338339.png)

From the **`Transform`** menu, you want to select **`Compute Variable`**
and the following window will open up.

Firstly, in **`Target Variabl`e** type in the name of the variable you
want to calculate. I've chosen '`Mean_IndividualReward`'.

Then double click **`All`** in the **`Function group`:** dropdown to see
all the calculations you could use. Scroll down to **`Mean`** in the
**`Functions and Special Variables`** dropdown. Have a look at some of
the other options. You can see **`Sum`** and **`Sqrt`** for example,
which is a calculated sum total and square root, respectively.

![](images/image-1431336267.png)

Using the **little blue arrow** pointing upwards, put **`Mean`** into
the **`Numeric Expression`** box. This is where you put in a simple
formula to tell SPSS how to calculate the new variable. You can use this
just like a calculator, and insert a variable then + then another
variable using the calculator keyboard. It's super easy.

![](images/image-1958330990.png)

It should look like the window above, and quite simply, you replace the
'`?`' with the variables you want to use from the left hand column. So,
you can double click on the variables in the left hand column to send
them up to the **`Numeric Expression`** box and separate them with
commas.

![](images/image-1943639971.png){width="400"}

![](images/image-1786701273.png){width="400"}

You see I have calculated the mean of 2 trials, but you can do this for
any number of variables. This is a useful tool and works like excel
formulae. It will then just pop a new column at the end of your dataset
with the relevant output of the calculation.

![](images/image-431115263.png){width="50"}

Do remember that if you want to perform other calculations, you can find
excellent help on the internet. Don't be afraid of trying things out and
exploring the features of SPSS. It is confusing at times, but once you
understand what it is trying to do, you'll find that it is very clever
and can save you time.
