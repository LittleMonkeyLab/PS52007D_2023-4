## Embracing the Dissertation Process

Welcome to the exciting journey of dissertation writing in psychology!
This chapter serves as your compass, guiding you through the critical
aspects of dissertation writing, post-data collection. Our focus here is
not just on the technicalities but on empowering you with the tools and
mindset needed to navigate this journey successfully, both this year,
and next!

You have a word limit of 2,500 words for the Year 2 Mini-Dissertation,
which may seem like a lot at this point in time. However, you have a
great deal of complicated information to convey in a rigorous structure,
and so you'll never do a good job if you try to do it all at once. The
best advice I can give you is to plan the work ahead of you, and deal
with each section individually and expect to write multiple drafts.

## The Rationale for APA 7 Formatting

American Psychological Association (APA) 7th edition formatting isn't
just about adhering to needless conventions; it's about clarity,
consistency, and presenting information in a way that is technically
proficient and accessible to intelligent readers, whether psychologists
or not! I'll delve into the essentials of APA 7, highlighting its
guiding principles and how it underpins the structure and presentation
of your research.

Although the structure and format of an APA 7 dissertation may seem
restrictive and somewhat artificial, it's designed to be consistent
across journal articles and dissertations. There's a huge amount of
support available online to which I point to you below where you can
look for information on stylistic elements and tone of voice.

On the topic of tone of voice, the biggest mistake that we see every
year is people trying to adopt an overly complex or unnatural tone of
voice. This is not the goal of APA style. Your goal should be to speak
in a technically advanced manner but that is accessible to an
intelligent reader. This will be primarily in the third person, so not
using 'I' or 'my'. The only exception to this will be in the *reflective
account* that comes after your references and is NOT included in the
word-count. So spend some time thinking about how best to phrase any of
the key terms in your dissertation (Variables, Conditions, Concepts etc)
and stick to it. Be consistent, find the best way of saying it and use
that rather than varying your terminology for the sake of variety.

grammar/style at APAStyle.org - from the horse's mouth, so to speak...

## Dissertation Structure Overview

Your dissertation needs to share all the hard work you have done this
year, and each section plays a crucial role. I'll provide an overview of
these sections in gratuitous detail, from the introduction to the
discussion, tailored for both the Mini-Dissertation, but also, entirely
relevant to your final year dissertation next year! You're welcome.

**Mini-Dissertation requirements**

**- Title:** Concise and informative.

**- Abstract:** Brief summary of the study.

**- Introduction**: Background information and purpose.

**- Method:** Details of the procedure.

**- Participants**

**- Materials**

**- Procedure**

**- Results:** Findings with statistical analysis.

**- Discussion:** Interpretation of results.

[***AND - Compulsory but NOT included in the word count***]{.underline}

**- References:** Cited works.

**- Reflective Account:**

**- Open Data:** Attachment -

\- **Open Materials:** Attachment -

## Time Management and Technical Tools

Time is a valuable ally in your dissertation process. I'll share
strategies to manage it effectively, including tips on utilizing Zotero
for reference management, leveraging library resources, and the
importance of regularly saving your work on OneDrive.

## Warning

Technical difficulties, such as losing drafts of your written work, will
NOT be acceptable grounds for extenuating circumstances. Please save
regularly and submit on time!
:::

## Leveraging Resources

-   **APA 7 Word Template**: Access the APA 7 Word Template provided by
    Gordon on the VLE page, a tool designed to simplify formatting. Why
    start from scratch?

-   **Examples and Rubrics**: Draw insights from the provided examples
    of previous work and a detailed marking rubric to understand
    expectations and standards.

-   **Open Data and Materials**: Embrace the principles of open data and
    materials for a transparent and reproducible research process.
    Examples will be provided this term, but this is an opportunity to
    show off your hard work!

-   **Reflective Account**: A reflective account is a critical part of
    your dissertation, allowing you to introspect and document your
    research journey. It is not part of the word count, and if you do
    not submit this element, your Mini-Dissertation is not complete.

## Moving Forward with Confidence

This chapter is just the beginning. As you progress, remember that your
dissertation is more than an academic requirement; it's a testament to
your growth as a researcher and psychologist. Embrace each step with
curiosity and determination, and you'll find the journey as rewarding as
the destination.

## A reminder of APA format sections

::: callout-tip
## It's just a slightly bigger lab report!

Please refer back to any guidance that you received in first year on lab
report writing, because it will be relevant entirely to the mini
dissertation. This also applies to any feedback you received for any of
the submissions.

Here's an overview of the main sections of an APA dissertation,
including brief summaries and advice for each section:

Certainly! Here's the adapted overview with the inclusion of the
Abstract section, following APA headings:

### Abstract

-   **Summary**: Provides a concise summary of your dissertation,
    including the research problem, methodology, results, and
    conclusions.
-   **Advice**: Keep it brief and informative, typically between 150 to
    250 words. The abstract should give readers a quick overview of your
    study's content and significance.

### 1. Introduction

-   **Summary**: Sets the stage for your research, introducing the
    problem, research questions, and objectives. Your introduction
    should finish with your hypotheses. Remember, you should have an
    hypothesis for each main effect and potentially the interaction
    effect too!
-   **Advice**: Start with a general description, then move to
    specifics. Synchronize your introduction with your conclusion to
    ensure coherence and alignment with your findings.

#### n.b. Introduction - Critical Evaluation of Previous Literature & Theory

-   **Summary**: Provides an overview of existing research related to
    your topic, identifying gaps and justifying your study. It is
    important to introduce any theoretical perspectives that exist.
-   **Advice**: Focus on the most relevant studies and integrate them
    into a cohesive narrative, sharing key information about the
    studies, results, and methods. This chapter often accounts for a
    significant portion of your dissertation.

### 2. Method Section

-   **Summary**: Describes the research design, participants, materials,
    and procedures used in your study.
-   **Advice**: Ensure clarity and detail for replicability. Clearly
    define your methods and justify your choices.

### 3. Results

-   **Summary**: Presents the findings of your research without
    interpretation. Includes statistical analyses, tables, and figures.
-   **Advice**: Be concise and precise. Use appropriate statistical
    tools and clearly present your data.

### 4. Discussion

-   **Summary**: Interprets the results, discusses their implications,
    and relates them to existing literature.
-   **Advice**: Offer a critical analysis of your findings and their
    significance. Discuss limitations and suggest areas for future
    research.

#### n.b. Discussion (Final Paragraph \~ Conclusion)

-   **Summary**: Summarizes the main findings, their implications, and
    the contribution of your research to the field.
-   **Advice**: Be succinct and reflective. Highlight the significance
    of your work and its potential impact.

### 5. References

-   **Summary**: Lists all sources cited in your dissertation following
    APA 7 guidelines.
-   **Advice**: Ensure accuracy and consistency in your citations.
    Regularly update your references throughout the writing process.

### 6. Open Data & Open Materials

-   **Summary**: Contains your data set and all the 'materials' required
    to replicate your study. These elements need to be 'curated',
    meaning that you take some time to make them user-friendly and
    hard-working. Remember that this is a mark-winning opportunity. And
    you've put in such a great deal of effort... Show it off!!
-   **Advice**: Use appendices for detailed tables, questionnaires, or
    additional data that support your research.

### 7. Reflective Account

-   **Important**: This does not count towards your word count. If you
    do not include this, your submission will be considered incomplete.
    It can be a few sentences or a couple of paragraphs, but please make
    it genuine. We will provide prompts in due course, but you can start
    writing this now!

This structure provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to
dissertation writing, ensuring each section contributes meaningfully to
the overall research narrative.

### Technical and Time Management Tips

-   Utilize Zotero for efficient reference management.
-   Regularly back up your work on OneDrive.
-   Follow the APA 7 Word Template for formatting ease. Simples.
-   Review examples of previous work and the detailed marking rubric for
    guidance.

### Closing

Remember, your dissertation is more than a series of chapters; it's a
cohesive narrative that showcases your research journey. Embrace open
data and materials principles for transparency and keep a reflective
account of your process. This is a dry-run for the Final Year
Dissertation, and all efforts towards monitoring the process now will
pay dividend then.
