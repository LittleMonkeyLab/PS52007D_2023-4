    "text": "Expectation management\nThe teaching team on the module are here because Psychological Research is one of our passions. We teach it to you because we know it to a hugely valuable skill, not just a programme requirement. We understand that you might not immediately think it’s going to be fun, or useful, but we aren’t going to continually try to coax you into activity. If necessary, consider how the skills involved will be important for your final grade, for your future career path, or for your general intellectual development. Then throw yourself into it.\nThe bare minimum expectation is to attend Lectures and Labs, to engage with the content, and to allocate independent study hours each and every week. How many hours will be a decision you need to make for yourself, but they are required EVERY week. This module is 25% of the year in terms of module weight, 29% of your year grade, and when combined with your final year dissertation, research contributes 50% of your final grade.\nIt is easy to get sidetracked with Essays during the course of the term. Please consider that those essays contribute 15% of a 15 credit module. The Critical Proposal is worth double that for starters, and your Mini-Dissertation is worth 10X more than any individual essay. Allocating too much time to the 5 essays and falling behind on your Mini-Dissertation is a really poor idea.\nMaterials on the VLE will be considered the ‘baseline’ and you should familiarise yourself with what is available there - it will be everything you need to do really well. We shall be offering ‘extras’ - resources that will support further exploration of a topic, developing further skills, or just interesting added-value content, you will find this under ‘DangerZone’ - these are optional, and if you wish to add anything to these, or suggest some content, please let me know - always happy to help!\nOn this site, resources may include short self-assessment quizzes. Answers are NOT tracked, so use these to test your comprehension, or identify areas for focus.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."

Or the first thing that employers usually ask for in Reference Request templates and questionnaires?\n“To what extent is the applicant able to work as part of a team?”\nI kid you not. And if you can’t operate effectively in a team, we have to say so. It’s a silly way to miss out on a job. View the process of team work as something that you actively allocate time to. Develop a process. Communicate. Plan. Evaluate.\nIn this module, we suggest a process based in Software Development, called Scrum. There are many variants and nuances, but the key component is a Stand-Up meeting. We propose that you use the first 15 minutes of EVERY lab to run such a meeting. Each team member has 1-2 minutes (VERY SHORT) to cover 3 topics. 1- What did you do last week? 2 - What are you going to do in today’s lab/this week? 3 - Do you anticipate any obstacles or problems?\nThis ensures accountability towards group goals, allows you to clearly identify areas you need to focus on, and to be ready to ask your Lab Tutor any questions that may obstruct your progress. Each week I will be giving a set of reasonable objectives to help you work out where you could/should be. These are obviously flexible, but you should look to make forward progress each and every week.\nIf you choose to use an alternative system to manage your team or your time, fine. But it cannot be replaced with nothing. Your Lab Tutor will be asking to see your plans, and see how you may have allocated tasks or responsibilities. It may sound like a burden, but this is what you will likely have to do with your supervisor next year, and certainly you’ll need these skills in later life. It takes a few minutes a week, but could save you DAYS!"

    "text": "How to prepare for each week in Research Methods\nMany hundreds of years ago, I was a Boy Scout, before that, I was a Brownie too, but that’s a story for another day. ‘Be Prepared’ is a valuable piece of advice.\nAnd that’s what I’m trying to help with here. You aren’t going to get the most out of the timetabled sessions, or your extensive independent study, if you don’t have a fair idea of what you need to do, by when, and what each activity entails.\nYour teaching team goes to a great deal of effort to answer any and all questions you might have, and we engineer the lectures and labs to preview any expected questions and also allow space for questions of the unexpected variety. But you have to ask them. To do this, you need to have a look ahead and identify anything that needs clarification.\nEach week, the Lab Tutors assemble a list of the FAQs from each lab and check to see if any themes are emerging and Gordon will then communicate any relevant answers via the module forum.\nRemember, a lack of preparation on your part is not an emergency on our part. And if you aren’t clear on what you need to do, it’s down to you to review all the VLE page content for information (it will be there), or ask the question via the forum or discuss it with your Lab Tutor in the lab.\nLectures are pretty straightforward. The content will be released on the Wednesday prior to the timetabled session, and will comprise both a prepare summary like this, but also the lecture slides and signposts to key readings. I release these on a Wednesday, as it allows me to incorporate any changes arising from the labs or the previous lecture.\nReview the lecture slides, have a poke around in the readings and try to familiarise yourself with any concepts that may be new to you. But the major point of the lectures is that you come along, pin back your ears, and engage with the content. More on that in the Module Overview.\nYou have a 2 hour lab each week, and although there will be some guided activities and skills shared, these sessions are ‘working sessions’ - designed to allow you to work productively on your Mini-Dissertations individually, or more usually, in your groups. It is expected that you coordinate with your group between classes, it’s not a great use of the session to use that to catch everyone up on things and have a bit of bants. 2 hours of industry will keep you moving through the stages of the module well, reducing the amount of time you might need to work independently, or more realistically, freeing that up for other things you need to prioritise, whether it’s work, life, or love.\nOr walkies with the faithful hound! ta ta G"

    "text": "Key Focus: The core of Science, Effect Sizes and Literature Search and management\n\n\n\nImportant Points:\n\nThe first thing that will happen in the labs this week is we will try to help people who missed last week, or who didn’t manage to find a group, to get settled into a group. If this applies to you, turn up on time (or a bit early) and announce yourself to the Lab Tutor.\nIf you are in a proto-group, you will be asked to complete a form (one per group) that has a group name, the group members (at this time) and anything that you think might be agreed or semi-agreed (general topic, methods you are interested in, working style etc). You will not be instructed to do this, you will be expected to just do this when you arrive.\nWe are going to be keen to help you in concrete ways this year. We are going to be wanting to see things on screen this week; Search Terms, Search Results, Lists of Key Authors etc. Be prepared to let us look over your shoulder, so that we can give feedback, to give you confidence to move forwards. If we don’t see notes or documents, we reserve the right to move on to another student/group and we will come back to you later.\n\nPreparatory Reading or Thinking:\n\nThe core of good scientific practice is asking clear questions and collecting data to answer that question. It sounds easy, but is VERY hard in practice. In the lecture, we shall be touching on experimental hypotheses extraneous and confounding variables and operationalising variables as well as other little gems that are crucial to your success this year.\nI have produced a brief introduction to Effect Sizes, and it can be found here or on the VLE. Please have a read and try to think about what it all means. You will need to be confident with this idea in order to meet the requirements for the Personality Essay and The Critical Proposal. You can discuss this with your Essay Tutor in the tutorial this week too!\nYou are encouraged to read along with the key topics we cover in these first weeks, as it may be that either you don’t immediately connect this with what you have already learned, or that you don’t see why this is important now. If this is the case, I am obviously sorry I didn’t manage to make it clear, as would always be my intention, but the reading list includes Howitt and Cramer Research Methods in Psychology and so Chapters 1 & 2 are worth a skim if this sounds like you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIF YOU ARE STILL UNGROUPED - You will need to make this clear to your Lab Tutor immediately at the start of the session. All students will be asked to detail the members of their groups, and to specify any agreements (Topic, possible methods, ethos, working style) at the start. If you don’t do this it positively hampers our ability to help you. Please take the 10 minutes to do this as fully as possible.\n\n\n\nStudents just arriving must approach the Lab Tutor immediately\nGroup data capture - Please start on this immediately - as much information as possible\nFollow the Worksheet for Literature Searching Tips and exercises\n(Re-)Familiarise yourself with the idea of Effect Sizes and see if you can find one relevant to either academic success or your research topic\nThe Lab Tutor will be circulating and looking at work on screen to see how you are doing. Ask for any help you need.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m in my group and we have a plan\nI’ve got a rough idea of the Topic of my Mini-Dissertation\nIf after today, I sit down and read, or jot down ideas, whether for Essay or MD - it’s useful productive work\n\n\n\n\nOnly you can be the judge of what is enough, or how much reading you are going to do. There is no single process for getting to the point where you feel comfortable answering an essay question or evaluating a journal article for your mini-dissertation.\nThis is where your understanding of your learning, your cognitive needs, your optimal operating window comes into play. If you don’t find this, we can’t give it to you."
