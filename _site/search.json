    "text": "When there is a true effect out there to measure, you want to make sure your design is sensitive enough to detect the effect, otherwise what’s the point. We’ve already talked about the idea that an effect can have different sizes. The next idea is that your design can be more less sensitive in its ability to reliabily measure the effect. We have discussed this general idea many times already in the textbook, for example we know that we will be more likely to detect “significant” effects (when there are real differences) when we increase our sample-size. Here, we will talk about the idea of design sensitivity in terms of the concept of power. Interestingly, the concept of power is a somewhat limited concept, in that it only exists as a concept within some philosophies of statistics.\n\n\nIn particular, the concept of power falls out of the Neyman-Pearson concept of null vs. alternative hypothesis testing. Up to this point, we have largely avoided this terminology. This is perhaps a disservice in that the Neyman-Pearson ideas are by now the most common and widespread, and in the opinion of some of us, they are also the most widely misunderstood and abused idea, which is why we have avoided these ideas until now.\nWhat we have been mainly doing is talking about hypothesis testing from the Fisherian (Sir Ronald Fisher, the ANOVA guy) perspective. This is a basic perspective that we think can’t be easily ignored. It is also quite limited. The basic idea is this:\n\nWe know that chance can cause some differences when we measure something between experimental conditions.\nWe want to rule out the possibility that the difference that we observed can not be due to chance\nWe construct large N designs that permit us to do this when a real effect is observed, such that we can confidently say that big differences that we find are so big (well outside the chance window) that it is highly implausible that chance alone could have produced.\nThe final conclusion is that chance was extremely unlikely to have produced the differences. We then infer that something else, like the manipulation, must have caused the difference.\nWe don’t say anything else about the something else.\nWe either reject the null distribution as an explanation (that chance couldn’t have done it), or retain the null (admit that chance could have done it, and if it did we couldn’t tell the difference between what we found and what chance could do)\n\nNeyman and Pearson introduced one more idea to this mix, the idea of an alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is the idea that if there is a true effect, then the data sampled into each condition of the experiment must have come from two different distributions. Remember, when there is no effect we assume all of the data cam from the same distribution (which by definition can’t produce true differences in the long run, because all of the numbers are coming from the same distribution). The graphs of effect-sizes from before show examples of these alternative distributions, with samples for condition A coming from one distribution, and samples from condition B coming from a shifted distribution with a different mean.\nSo, under the Neyman-Pearson tradition, when a researcher find a signifcant effect they do more than one things. First, they reject the null-hypothesis of no differences, and they accept the alternative hypothesis that there was differences. This seems like a sensible thing to do. And, because the researcher is actually interested in the properties of the real effect, they might be interested in learning more about the actual alternative hypothesis, that is they might want to know if their data come from two different distributions that were separated by some amount…in other words, they would want to know the size of the effect that they were measuring.\n\n\n\nWe have now discussed enough ideas to formalize the concept of statistical power. For this concept to exist we need to do a couple things.\n\nAgree to set an alpha criterion. When the p-value for our test-statistic is below this value we will call our finding statistically significant, and agree to reject the null hypothesis and accept the “alternative” hypothesis (sidenote, usually it isn’t very clear which specific alternative hypothesis was accepted)\nIn advance of conducting the study, figure out what kinds of effect-sizes our design is capable of detecting with particular probabilites.\n\nThe power of a study is determined by the relationship between\n\nThe sample-size of the study\nThe effect-size of the manipulation\nThe alpha value set by the researcher.\n\nTo see this in practice let’s do a simulation. We will do a t-test on a between-groups design 10 subjects in each group. Group A will be a control group with scores sampled from a normal distribution with mean of 10, and standard deviation of 5. Group B will be a treatment group, we will say the treatment has an effect-size of Cohen’s \\(d\\) = .5, that’s a standard deviation shift of .5, so the scores with come from a normal distribution with mean =12.5 and standard deivation of 5. Remember 1 standard deviation here is 5, so half of a standard deviation is 2.5.\nThe following R script runs this simulated experiment 1000 times. We set the alpha criterion to .05, this means we will reject the null whenever the \\(p\\)-value is less than .05. With this specific design, how many times out of of 1000 do we reject the null, and accept the alternative hypothesis?\n\n\nCode\np&lt;-length(1000)\nfor(i in 1:1000){\n  A&lt;-rnorm(10,10,5)\n  B&lt;-rnorm(10,12.5,5)\n  p[i]&lt;-t.test(A,B,var.equal = TRUE)$p.value\n}\n\nlength(p[p&lt;.05])\n\n\n[1] 177\n\n\nThe answer is that we reject the null, and accept the alternative 177 times out of 1000. In other words our experiment succesfully accepts the alternative hypothesis 17.7 percent of the time, this is known as the power of the study. Power is the probability that a design will succesfully detect an effect of a specific size.\nImportantly, power is completely abstract idea that is completely determined by many assumptions including N, effect-size, and alpha. As a result, it is best not to think of power as a single number, but instead as a family of numbers.\nFor example, power is different when we change N. If we increase N, our samples will more precisely estimate the true distributions that they came from. Increasing N reduces sampling error, and shrinks the range of differences that can be produced by chance. Lets’ increase our N in this simulation from 10 to 20 in each group and see what happens.\n\n\nCode\np&lt;-length(1000)\nfor(i in 1:1000){\n  A&lt;-rnorm(20,10,5)\n  B&lt;-rnorm(20,12.5,5)\n  p[i]&lt;-t.test(A,B,var.equal = TRUE)$p.value\n}\n\nlength(p[p&lt;.05])\n\n\n[1] 325\n\n\nNow the number of significant experiments i 325 out of 1000, or a power of 32.5 percent. That’s roughly doubled from before. We have made the design more sensitive to the effect by increasing N.\nWe can change the power of the design by changing the alpha-value, which tells us how much evidence we need to reject the null. For example, if we set the alpha criterion to 0.01, then we will be more conservative, only rejecting the null when chance can produce the observed difference 1% of the time. In our example, this will have the effect of reducing power. Let’s keep N at 20, but reduce the alpha to 0.01 and see what happens:\n\n\nCode\np&lt;-length(1000)\nfor(i in 1:1000){\n  A&lt;-rnorm(20,10,5)\n  B&lt;-rnorm(20,12.5,5)\n  p[i]&lt;-t.test(A,B,var.equal = TRUE)$p.value\n}\n\nlength(p[p&lt;.01])\n\n\n[1] 145\n\n\nNow only 145 out of 1000 experiments are significant, that’s 14.5 power.\nFinally, the power of the design depends on the actual size of the effect caused by the manipulation. In our example, we hypothesized that the effect caused a shift of .5 standard deviations. What if the effect causes a bigger shift? Say, a shift of 2 standard deviations. Let’s keep N= 20, and alpha &lt; .01, but change the effect-size to two standard deviations. When the effect in the real-world is bigger, it should be easier to measure, so our power will increase.\n\n\nCode\np&lt;-length(1000)\nfor(i in 1:1000){\n  A&lt;-rnorm(20,10,5)\n  B&lt;-rnorm(20,30,5)\n  p[i]&lt;-t.test(A,B,var.equal = TRUE)$p.value\n}\n\nlength(p[p&lt;.01])\n\n\n[1] 1000\n\n\nNeat, if the effect-size is actually huge (2 standard deviation shift), then we have power 100 percent to detect the true effect.\n\n\n\nWe mentioned that it is best to think of power as a family of numbers, rather than as a single number. To elaborate on this consider the power curve below. This is the power curve for a specific design: a between groups experiments with two levels, that uses an independent samples t-test to test whether an observed difference is due to chance. Critically, N is set to 10 in each group, and alpha is set to .05\nIn Figure 1 power (as a proportion, not a percentage) is plotted on the y-axis, and effect-size (Cohen’s d) in standard deviation units is plotted on the x-axis.\n\n\nCode\npower&lt;-c()\nfor(i in seq(0,2,.1)){\nsd_AB &lt;- 1\nn&lt;-10\nC &lt;- qnorm(0.975)\nse &lt;- sqrt( sd_AB/n + sd_AB/n )\ndelta&lt;-i\npower &lt;- c(power,1-pnorm(C-delta/se) + pnorm(-C-delta/se))\n}\n\nplot_df&lt;-data.frame(power,\n                    effect_size = seq(0,2,.1))\n\nggplot(plot_df, aes(x=effect_size, y=power))+\n  geom_line()+\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This figure shows power as a function of effect-size (Cohen’s d) for a between-subjects independent samples t-test, with N=10, and alpha criterion 0.05.\n\n\n\n\nA power curve like this one is very helpful to understand the sensitivity of a particular design. For example, we can see that a between subjects design with N=10 in both groups, will detect an effect of d=.5 (half a standard deviation shift) about 20% of the time, will detect an effect of d=.8 about 50% of the time, and will detect an effect of d=2 about 100% of the time. All of the percentages reflect the power of the design, which is the percentage of times the design would be expected to find a \\(p\\) &lt; 0.05.\nLet’s imagine that based on prior research, the effect you are interested in measuring is fairly small, d=0.2. If you want to run an experiment that will detect an effect of this size a large percentage of the time, how many subjects do you need to have in each group? We know from the above graph that with N=10, power is very low to detect an effect of d=0.2. Let’s make Figure 2 and vary the number of subjects rather than the size of the effect.\n\n\nCode\npower&lt;-c()\nfor(i in seq(10,800,10)){\nsd_AB &lt;- 1\nn&lt;-i\nC &lt;- qnorm(0.975)\nse &lt;- sqrt( sd_AB/n + sd_AB/n )\ndelta&lt;-0.2\npower &lt;- c(power,1-pnorm(C-delta/se) + pnorm(-C-delta/se))\n}\n\nplot_df&lt;-data.frame(power,\n                    N = seq(10,800,10))\n\nggplot(plot_df, aes(x=N, y=power))+\n  geom_line()+\n  theme_classic()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=.8, color=\"green\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This figure shows power as a function of N for a between-subjects independent samples t-test, with d=0.2, and alpha criterion 0.05.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure plots power to detect an effect of d=0.2, as a function of N. The green line shows where power = .8, or 80%. It looks like we would nee about 380 subjects in each group to measure an effect of d=0.2, with power = .8. This means that 80% of our experiments would succesfully show p &lt; 0.05. Often times power of 80% is recommended as a reasonable level of power, however even when your design has power = 80%, your experiment will still fail to find an effect (associated with that level of power) 20% of the time!"

We set the alpha criterion to .05, this means we will reject the null whenever the \\(p\\)-value is less than .05. With this specific design, how many times out of of 1000 do we reject the null, and accept the alternative hypothesis?\n\n\nCode\np&lt;-length(1000)\nfor(i in 1:1000){\n  A&lt;-rnorm(10,10,5)\n  B&lt;-rnorm(10,12.5,5)\n  p[i]&lt;-t.test(A,B,var.equal = TRUE)$p.value\n}\n\nlength(p[p&lt;.05])\n\n\n[1] 177\n\n\nThe answer is that we reject the null, and accept the alternative 177 times out of 1000.

    "section": "Some considerations",
    "text": "Some considerations\n\nLow powered studies\nConsider the following case. A researcher runs a study to detect an effect of interest. There is good reason, from prior research, to believe the effect-size is d=0.5. The researcher uses a design that has 30% power to detect the effect. They run the experiment and find a significant p-value, (p&lt;.05). They conclude their manipulation worked, because it was unlikely that their result could have been caused by chance. How would you interpret the results of a study like this? Would you agree with thte researchers that the manipulation likely caused the difference? Would you be skeptical of the result?\nThe situation above requires thinking about two kinds of probabilities. On the one hand we know that the result observed by the researchers does not occur often by chance (p is less than 0.05). At the same time, we know that the design was underpowered, it only detects results of the expected size 30% of the time. We are face with wondering what kind of luck was driving the difference. The researchers could have gotten unlucky, and the difference really could be due to chance. In this case, they would be making a type I error (saying the result is real when it isn’t). If the result was not due to chance, then they would also be lucky, as their design only detects this effect 30% of the time.\nPerhaps another way to look at this situation is in terms of the replicability of the result. Replicability refers to whether or not the findings of the study would be the same if the experiment was repeated. Because we know that power is low here (only 30%), we would expect that most replications of this experiment would not find a significant effect. Instead, the experiment would be expected to replicate only 30% of the time.\n\n\nLarge N and small effects\nPerhaps you have noticed that there is an intriguiing relationship between N (sample-size) and power and effect-size. As N increases, so does power to detect an effect of a particular size. Additionally, as N increases, a design is capable of detecting smaller and smaller effects with greater and greater power. For example, if N was large enough, we would have high power to detect very small effects, say d= 0.01, or even d=0.001. Let’s think about what this means.\nImagine a drug company told you that they ran an experiment with 1 billion people to test whether their drug causes a significant change in headache pain. Let’s say they found a significant effect (with power =100%), but the effect was very small, it turns out the drug reduces headache pain by less than 1%, let’s say 0.01%. For our imaginary study we will also assume that this effect is very real, and not caused by chance.\nClearly the design had enough power to detect the effect, and the effect was there, so the design did detect the effect. However, the issue is that there is little practical value to this effect. Nobody is going to by a drug to reduce their headache pain by 0.01%, even if it was “scientifcally proven” to work. This example brings up two issues. First, increasing N to very large levels will allow designs to detect almost any effect (even very tiny ones) with very high power. Second, sometimes effects are meaningless when they are very small, especially in applied research such as drug studies.\nThese two issues can lead to interesting suggestions. For example, someone might claim that large N studies aren’t very useful, because they can always detect really tiny effects that are practically meaningless. On the other hand, large N studies will also detect larger effects too, and they will give a better estimate of the “true” effect in the population (because we know that larger samples do a better job of estimating population parameters). Additionally, although really small effects are often not interesting in the context of applied research, they can be very important in theoretical research. For example, one theory might predict that manipulating X should have no effect, but another theory might predict that X does have an effect, even if it is a small one. So, detecting a small effect can have theoretical implication that can help rule out false theories. Generally speaking, researchers asking both theoretical and applied questions should think about and establish guidelines for “meaningful” effect-sizes so that they can run designs of appropriate size to detect effects of “meaningful size”.\n\n\nSmall N and Large effects\nAll other things being equal would you trust the results from a study with small N or large N? This isn’t a trick question, but sometimes people tie themselves into a knot trying to answer it. We already know that large sample-sizes provide better estimates of the distributions the samples come from. As a result, we can safely conclude that we should trust the data from large N studies more than small N studies.\nAt the same time, you might try to convince yourself otherwise. For example, you know that large N studies can detect very small effects that are practically and possibly even theoretically meaningless. You also know that that small N studies are only capable of reliably detecting very large effects. So, you might reason that a small N study is better than a large N study because if a small N study detects an effect, that effect must be big and meaningful; whereas, a large N study could easily detect an effect that is tiny and meaningless.\nThis line of thinking needs some improvement. First, just because a large N study can detect small effects, doesn’t mean that it only detects small effects. If the effect is large, a large N study will easily detect it. Large N studies have the power to detect a much wider range of effects, from small to large. Second, just because a small N study detected an effect, does not mean that the effect is real, or that the effect is large. For example, small N studies have more variability, so the estimate of the effect size will have more error. Also, there is 5% (or alpha rate) chance that the effect was spurious. Interestingly, there is a pernicious relationship between effect-size and type I error rate\n\n\nType I errors are convincing when N is small\nSo what is this pernicious relationship between Type I errors and effect-size? Mainly, this relationship is pernicious for small N studies. For example, the following figure illustrates the results of 1000s of simulated experiments, all assuming the null distribution. In other words, for all of these simulations there is no true effect, as the numbers are all sampled from an identical distribution (normal distribution with mean =0, and standard deviation =1). The true effect-size is 0 in all cases.\nWe know that under the null, researchers will find p values that are less 5% about 5% of the time, remember that is the definition. So, if a researcher happened to be in this situation (where there manipulation did absolutely nothing), they would make a type I error 5% of the time, or if they conducted 100 experiments, they would expect to find a significant result for 5 of them.\nFigure 3 reports the findings from only the type I errors, where the simulated study did produce p &lt; 0.05. For each type I error, we calculated the exact p-value, as well as the effect-size (cohen’s D) (mean difference divided by standard deviation). We already know that the true effect-size is zero, however take a look at this graph, and pay close attention to the smaller sample-sizes.\n\n\nCode\nall_df&lt;-data.frame()\nfor(i in 1:1000){\n  for(n in c(10,20,50,100,1000)){\n    some_data&lt;-rnorm(n,0,1)\n    p_value&lt;-t.test(some_data)$p.value\n    effect_size&lt;-mean(some_data)/sd(some_data)\n    mean_scores&lt;-mean(some_data)\n    standard_error&lt;-sd(some_data)/sqrt(length(some_data))\n    t_df&lt;-data.frame(sim=i,sample_size=n,p_value,effect_size,mean_scores,standard_error)\n    all_df&lt;-rbind(all_df,t_df)\n  }\n}\n\ntype_I_error &lt;-all_df[all_df$p_value&lt;.05,]\ntype_I_error$sample_size&lt;-as.factor(type_I_error$sample_size)\n\nggplot(type_I_error,aes(x=p_value,y=effect_size, group=sample_size,color=sample_size))+\n  geom_point()+\n  theme_classic()+\n  ggtitle(\"Effect sizes for type I errors\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Effect size as a function of p-values for type 1 Errors under the null, for a paired samples t-test.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, look at the red dots, when sample size is 10. Here we see that the effect-sizes are quite large. When p is near 0.05 the effect-size is around .8, and it goes up and up as when p gets smaller and smaller. What does this mean? It means that when you get unlucky with a small N design, and your manipulation does not work, but you by chance find a “significant” effect, the effect-size measurement will show you a “big effect”. This is the pernicious aspect. When you make a type I error for small N, your data will make you think there is no way it could be a type I error because the effect is just so big!. Notice that when N is very large, like 1000, the measure of effect-size approaches 0 (which is the true effect-size in the simulation shown in Figure 4).\n\n\nCode\nall_df&lt;-data.frame()\nfor(i in 1:10000){\n  sample      &lt;- rnorm(50,100,20)\n  sample_mean &lt;- mean(sample[1:25]-sample[26:50])\n  sample_sem  &lt;- sd(sample)/sqrt(length(sample))\n  sample_t    &lt;- t.test(sample, mu=100)$statistic\n  sample_d    &lt;- (mean(sample)-100)/sd(sample)\n  t_df&lt;-data.frame(i,sample_mean,\n                   sample_sem,\n                   sample_t,\n                   sample_d)\n  all_df&lt;-rbind(all_df,t_df)\n}\n\nlibrary(ggpubr)\na&lt;-ggplot(all_df,aes(x=sample_mean))+\n  geom_histogram(color=\"white\")+\n  theme_classic()\nb&lt;-ggplot(all_df,aes(x=sample_sem))+\n  geom_histogram(color=\"white\")+\n  theme_classic()\nc&lt;-ggplot(all_df,aes(x=sample_t))+\n  geom_histogram(color=\"white\")+\n  theme_classic()\nd&lt;-ggplot(all_df,aes(x=sample_d))+\n  geom_histogram(color=\"white\")+\n  theme_classic()\n\nggarrange(a,b,c,d,\n          ncol = 2, nrow = 2)\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

We will be talking about some of the crises Psychology has faced (and continues to face) over the course of the year. But the only way we can resolve some of these issues is by training future Psychologists to be better than those who have come before. I think you will very quickly notice that published research often doesn’t conform to the ‘rules’ we are teaching you. If you notice this… take that as evidence that you are well on your way to being better than them!\nFirst, it is worth pointing out that over the years, at least in Psychology, many societies and journals have made strong recommendations about how researchers should report their statistical analyses. Among the recommendations is that measures of “effect size” should be reported. Similarly, many journals now require that researchers report an “a priori” power-analysis (the recommendation is this should be done before the data is collected). Because these recommendations are so prevalent, it is worth discussing what these ideas refer to. Indeed, you will be identifying Effect Sizes and calculating them in your Mini-Dissertations, and performing an a priori power calculation when you submit an Ethics Application in both Year 2 and 3 for you Dissertations.\nEffect Sizes and Power can seem confusing unless you are actually ‘doing’ research or thinking about research in a more systematic way, considering multiple studies on a similar topic. This is why now is the ideal time to deal with them. You are both actively researching, and looking to summarise the results of multiple studies. Let’s crack on.\nThe question or practice of using measures of effect size and conducting power-analyses are also good examples of the more general need to think about about what you are doing. If you are going to report effect size, and conduct power analyses, these activities should not be done blindly because someone else recommends that you do them, these activities and other suitable ones should be done as a part of justifying what you are doing. It is a part of thinking about how to make your data answer questions for you. Matthew Crumps book (on which this content is based is called ‘Answering Questions with Data’ and is an excellent summary of this process we call Science - see citation below)\n\n\nLet’s cover a key point again. Primarily, researchers are interested in whether their manipulation causes a change in their measurement. If it does, they can become confident that they have uncovered a causal force (the manipulation).\nHowever, we know that differences in the measure between experimental conditions can arise by chance alone, just by sampling error, or by dint of the people in two randomly allocated groups. In fact, we can create pictures that show us the window of chance for a given statistic, these tell us roughly the range and likelihoods of getting various differences just by chance. With these windows in hand, we can then determine whether the differences we found in some data that we collected were likely or unlikely to be due to chance. We also learned that sample-size plays a big role in the shape of the ‘chance window’. Small samples give chance a large opportunity to make big differences. Large samples give chance a smaller opportunity to make big differences. The general lesson up to this point has been, design an experiment with a large enough sample to detect the effect of interest. If your study isn’t well designed, you could easily be measuring noise or random variation, and your differences could be caused by sampling error or individual variability. Generally speaking, this is still a very good lesson: better designs produce better data; and you can’t fix a broken design after the data are collected, e.g. by using statistics.\nBy running your Mini-Dissertation, and collecting real data early, we hope that this is one of the lessons you are able to learn. If you make a mistake in the design of your study, you’ll have to live with that all the way through the process, and you’ll kick yourself. That’s why we encourage you to enjoy this first opportunity and to make some mistakes with a smile. Those who do, will learn far more than those who don’t! But don’t worry. Gordon will be trying to model good (and less good) research behaviour, so that you get lots of learning opportunities.\nThere is clearly another thing that can determine whether or not your differences are due to chance. That is the effect itself. If the manipulation does cause a change, then there is an effect, and that effect is a real one. Effects refer to differences in the measurement between experimental conditions. The thing about effects is that they can be big or small, they have a size.\nFor example, you can think of a manipulation in terms of the size of its hammer. A strong manipulation is like a jack-hammer: it is loud, it produces a big effect, it creates huge differences. A medium manipulation is like regular hammer: it works, you can hear it, it drives a nail into wood, but it doesn’t destroy concrete like a jack-hammer, it produces a reliable effect. A small manipulation is like tapping something with a pencil: it does something, you can barely hear it, and only in a quiet room, it doesn’t do a good job of driving a nail into wood, and it does nothing to concrete, it produces tiny, unreliable effects. Finally, a really small effect would be hammering something with a feather, it leaves almost no mark and does nothing that is obviously perceptible to nails or pavement. The lesson is, if you want to break up concrete, use a jack-hammer; or, if you want to measure your effect, make your manipulation stronger (like a jack-hammer) so it produces a bigger difference that can be spotted easily. There is no prize for subtlety when it comes to an experimental manipulation. If in doubt, give it some clout!\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the big concept of effect size, is simply how big the differences are between people who don’t get your manipulation, and those that do, that’s it. However, the biggness or smallness of effects quickly becomes a little bit complicated. On the one hand, the raw difference in the means can be very meaningful. Let’s say we are measuring performance on a final exam, and we are testing whether or not a miracle drug can make you do better on the test. Let’s say taking the drug makes you do 5% better on the test, compared to not taking the drug. You know what 5% means, that’s basically a whole category higher. Pretty good. An effect-size of 25% would be even better right! Lot’s of measures have a concrete quality to them, and it makes sense to state the size of the effect expressed in terms of the original measure.\nLet’s talk about concrete measures some more. How about learning a musical instrument. Let’s say it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert piano, violin, or guitar player. And, let’s say you found something online that says that using their method, you will learn the instrument in less time than normal. That is a claim about the effect size of their method. You would want to know how big the effect is right? For example, the effect-size could be 10 hours. That would mean it would take you 9,980 hours to become an expert (that’s a whole 10 hours less). If I knew the effect-size was so tiny, I wouldn’t bother with their new method, I might reason I could make that sort of effect by saving my money and using it to buy snacks. But, if the effect size was say 1,000 hours, that’s a pretty big deal, that’s 10% less (still doesn’t seem like much, but saving 1,000 hours seems like a lot).\nJust as often as we have concrete measures that are readily interpretable (hours, percentages, snack-equivalents), Psychology often produces measures that are extremely difficult to interpret. For example, questionnaire measures often have no concrete meaning, and only an abstract statistical meaning. If you wanted to know whether a manipulation caused people to be more or less happy, and you used a questionnaire to measure happiness in happy units, you might find that people were 50 happy in condition 1, and 60 happy in condition 2, that’s a difference of 10 happy units. But how much is 10? Is that a big or small difference? A smile to a toothy smile? ROFL? It’s not immediately obvious. What is the solution here? A common solution is to provide a standardized measure of the difference, like a z-score. For example, if a difference of 10 reflected a shift of one standard deviation that would be useful to know, and that would be a sizeable shift. If the difference was only a tenth of the naturally occurring standard deviation, then the difference of 10 wouldn’t be very large at all, you’d probably have difficulty spotting it in the wild. We elaborate on this idea next in describing cohen’s d.\n\n\n\nLet’s look a few distributions to firm up some ideas about effect-size. Figure 1 has four panels. The first panel (0) represents the null distribution of no differences. This is the idea that your manipulation (A vs. B) doesn’t do anything at all, as a result when you measure scores in conditions A and B, you are effectively sampling scores from the very same overall distribution. The panel shows the distribution as green for condition B, but the red one for condition A is identical and drawn underneath (it’s invisible). There is 0 difference between these distributions, so it represents a null effect. Zilch.\n\n\nCode\nX &lt;- c(\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1)\n)\nY &lt;- c(\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 0, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 0, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 0, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), .5, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 0, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 1, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 0, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 2, 1)\n)\neffect_size &lt;- rep(c(0, .5, 1, 2), each = 101 * 2)\ncondition &lt;- rep(rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 101), 2)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(effect_size,\n                 condition,\n                 X, Y)\n\nggplot(df, aes(\n  x = X,\n  y = Y,\n  group = condition,\n  color = condition\n)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_classic(base_size = 15) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ effect_size) +\n  xlab(\"values\") +\n  ylab(\"density\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Each panel shows hypothetical distributions for two conditions. As the effect-size increases, the difference between the distributions become larger.\n\n\n\n\nThe remaining panels are hypothetical examples of what a true effect could look like, when your manipulation actually causes a difference. For example, if condition A is a control group, and condition B is a treatment group (our magic study drug), we are looking at three cases where the treatment manipulation causes a positive shift in the mean of the treatment group distribution. We are using normal curves with mean =0 and sd =1 for this demonstration, so a shift of .5 is a shift of half of a standard deviation. A shift of 1 is a shift of 1 standard deviation, and a shift of 2 is a shift of 2 standard deviations. We could draw many more examples showing even bigger shifts, or shifts that go in the other direction.\nLet’s look at another example, but this time we’ll use some concrete measurements. Let’s say we are looking at final exam performance, so our numbers are grade percentages. Let’s also say that we know the mean on the test is 65%, with a standard deviation of 5%. Group A could be a control that just takes the test, Group B could receive some “educational” manipulation designed to improve the test score. These graphs then show us some hypotheses about what the manipulation may or may not be doing.\n\n\nCode\nX &lt;- c(\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1)\n)\nY &lt;- c(\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 65, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 65, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 65, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 67.5, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 65, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 70, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 65, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 75, 5)\n)\neffect_size &lt;-\n  rep(c(\"65, d=0\", \"67.5,d=.5\", \"70, d=1\", \"75, d=2\"), each = 76 * 2)\ncondition &lt;- rep(rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 76), 2)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(effect_size,\n                 condition,\n                 X, Y)\n\nggplot(df, aes(\n  x = X,\n  y = Y,\n  group = condition,\n  color = condition\n)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_classic(base_size = 15) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ effect_size) +\n  xlab(\"values\") +\n  ylab(\"density\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Each panel shows hypothetical distributions for two conditions. As the effect-size increases, the difference between the distributions become larger.\n\n\n\n\nThe first panel shows that both condition A and B will sample test scores from the same distribution (mean =65, with 0 effect). The other panels show shifted mean for condition B (the treatment that is supposed to increase test performance). So, the treatment could increase the test performance by 2.5% (mean 67.5, .5 sd shift), or by 5% (mean 70, 1 sd shift), or by 10% (mean 75%, 2 sd shift), or by any other amount. In terms of our previous metaphor, a shift of 2 standard deviations is more like a jack-hammer in terms of size, and a shift of .5 standard deviations is more like using a pencil. The thing about research, is we often have no clue about whether our manipulation will produce a big or small effect, that’s why we are conducting the research - to find out!\nYou might have noticed that the letter \\(d\\) appears in the above figure. Why is that? Jacob Cohen Cohen (1988) used the letter \\(d\\) in defining the effect-size for this situation, and now everyone calls it Cohen’s \\(d\\). The formula for Cohen’s \\(d\\) is below (no need to memorise this!):\n\\(d = \\frac{\\text{mean for condition 1} - \\text{mean for condition 2}}{\\text{population standard deviation}}\\)\nIf you notice, this is just a kind of z-score. It is a way to standardize the mean difference in terms of the population standard deviation. It uses the Standard Deviation as a unit of measurement.\nIt is also worth noting again that this measure of effect-size is entirely hypothetical for most purposes. In general, researchers do not know the population standard deviation, they can only guess at it, or estimate it from the sample. The same goes for means, in the formula these are hypothetical mean differences in two population distributions. In practice, researchers do not know these values, they guess at them from their samples. When we talk about replication efforts, we will consider this. For example, if I try to replicate an experiment published in a journal article, and do an amazing job, but my participants are fundamentally different, the performance may be different across the board, and although the effect is consistent, the results may look different due to the type of people tested.\nBefore discussing why the concept of effect-size can be useful, we note that Cohen’s \\(d\\) is useful for understanding abstract measures. For example, when you don’t know what a difference of 10 or 20 means as a raw score, you can standardize the difference by the sample standard deviation, then you know roughly how big the effect is in terms of standard units. If you thought a `20 happys` was big, but it turned out to be only 1/10th of a standard deviation, then you would know the effect is actually quite small with respect to the overall variability in the data."

But, if the effect size was say 1,000 hours, that’s a pretty big deal, that’s 10% less (still doesn’t seem like much, but saving 1,000 hours seems like a lot).\nJust as often as we have concrete measures that are readily interpretable (hours, percentages, snack-equivalents), Psychology often produces measures that are extremely difficult to interpret. For example, questionnaire measures often have no concrete meaning, and only an abstract statistical meaning. If you wanted to know whether a manipulation caused people to be more or less happy, and you used a questionnaire to measure happiness in happy units, you might find that people were 50 happy in condition 1, and 60 happy in condition 2, that’s a difference of 10 happy units. But how much is 10? Is that a big or small difference? A smile to a toothy smile? ROFL? It’s not immediately obvious. What is the solution here? A common solution is to provide a standardized measure of the difference, like a z-score. For example, if a difference of 10 reflected a shift of one standard deviation that would be useful to know, and that would be a sizeable shift. If the difference was only a tenth of the naturally occurring standard deviation, then the difference of 10 wouldn’t be very large at all, you’d probably have difficulty spotting it in the wild. We elaborate on this idea next in describing cohen’s d.\n\n\n\nLet’s look a few distributions to firm up some ideas about effect-size. Figure 1 has four panels. The first panel (0) represents the null distribution of no differences. This is the idea that your manipulation (A vs. B) doesn’t do anything at all, as a result when you measure scores in conditions A and B, you are effectively sampling scores from the very same overall distribution. The panel shows the distribution as green for condition B, but the red one for condition A is identical and drawn underneath (it’s invisible). There is 0 difference between these distributions, so it represents a null effect. Zilch.\n\n\nCode\nX &lt;- c(\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1),\n  seq(-5, 5, .1)\n)\nY &lt;- c(\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 0, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 0, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 0, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), .5, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 0, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 1, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 0, 1),\n  dnorm(seq(-5, 5, .1), 2, 1)\n)\neffect_size &lt;- rep(c(0, .5, 1, 2), each = 101 * 2)\ncondition &lt;- rep(rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 101), 2)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(effect_size,\n                 condition,\n                 X, Y)\n\nggplot(df, aes(\n  x = X,\n  y = Y,\n  group = condition,\n  color = condition\n)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_classic(base_size = 15) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ effect_size) +\n  xlab(\"values\") +\n  ylab(\"density\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Each panel shows hypothetical distributions for two conditions. As the effect-size increases, the difference between the distributions become larger.\n\n\n\n\nThe remaining panels are hypothetical examples of what a true effect could look like, when your manipulation actually causes a difference. For example, if condition A is a control group, and condition B is a treatment group (our magic study drug), we are looking at three cases where the treatment manipulation causes a positive shift in the mean of the treatment group distribution. We are using normal curves with mean =0 and sd =1 for this demonstration, so a shift of .5 is a shift of half of a standard deviation. A shift of 1 is a shift of 1 standard deviation, and a shift of 2 is a shift of 2 standard deviations. We could draw many more examples showing even bigger shifts, or shifts that go in the other direction.\nLet’s look at another example, but this time we’ll use some concrete measurements. Let’s say we are looking at final exam performance, so our numbers are grade percentages. Let’s also say that we know the mean on the test is 65%, with a standard deviation of 5%. Group A could be a control that just takes the test, Group B could receive some “educational” manipulation designed to improve the test score. These graphs then show us some hypotheses about what the manipulation may or may not be doing.\n\n\nCode\nX &lt;- c(\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1),\n  seq(25, 100, 1)\n)\nY &lt;- c(\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 65, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 65, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 65, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 67.5, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 65, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 70, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 65, 5),\n  dnorm(seq(25, 100, 1), 75, 5)\n)\neffect_size &lt;-\n  rep(c(\"65, d=0\", \"67.5,d=.5\", \"70, d=1\", \"75, d=2\"), each = 76 * 2)\ncondition &lt;- rep(rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 76), 2)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(effect_size,\n                 condition,\n                 X, Y)\n\nggplot(df, aes(\n  x = X,\n  y = Y,\n  group = condition,\n  color = condition\n)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_classic(base_size = 15) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ effect_size) +\n  xlab(\"values\") +\n  ylab(\"density\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Each panel shows hypothetical distributions for two conditions. As the effect-size increases, the difference between the distributions become larger.\n\n\n\n\nThe first panel shows that both condition A and B will sample test scores from the same distribution (mean =65, with 0 effect). The other panels show shifted mean for condition B (the treatment that is supposed to increase test performance). So, the treatment could increase the test performance by 2.5% (mean 67.5, .5 sd shift), or by 5% (mean 70, 1 sd shift), or by 10% (mean 75%, 2 sd shift), or by any other amount. In terms of our previous metaphor, a shift of 2 standard deviations is more like a jack-hammer in terms of size, and a shift of .5 standard deviations is more like using a pencil. The thing about research, is we often have no clue about whether our manipulation will produce a big or small effect, that’s why we are conducting the research - to find out!\nYou might have noticed that the letter \\(d\\) appears in the above figure. Why is that? Jacob Cohen Cohen (1988) used the letter \\(d\\) in defining the effect-size for this situation, and now everyone calls it Cohen’s \\(d\\). The formula for Cohen’s \\(d\\) is below (no need to memorise this!):\n\\(d = \\frac{\\text{mean for condition 1} - \\text{mean for condition 2}}{\\text{population standard deviation}}\\)\nIf you notice, this is just a kind of z-score. It is a way to standardize the mean difference in terms of the population standard deviation. It uses the Standard Deviation as a unit of measurement.\nIt is also worth noting again that this measure of effect-size is entirely hypothetical for most purposes. In general, researchers do not know the population standard deviation, they can only guess at it, or estimate it from the sample. The same goes for means, in the formula these are hypothetical mean differences in two population distributions. In practice, researchers do not know these values, they guess at them from their samples. When we talk about replication efforts, we will consider this. For example, if I try to replicate an experiment published in a journal article, and do an amazing job, but my participants are fundamentally different, the performance may be different across the board, and although the effect is consistent, the results may look different due to the type of people tested.\nBefore discussing why the concept of effect-size can be useful, we note that Cohen’s \\(d\\) is useful for understanding abstract measures. For example, when you don’t know what a difference of 10 or 20 means as a raw score, you can standardize the difference by the sample standard deviation, then you know roughly how big the effect is in terms of standard units. If you thought a `20 happys` was big, but it turned out to be only 1/10th of a standard deviation, then you would know the effect is actually quite small with respect to the overall variability in the data."

We teach it to you because we know it to a hugely valuable skill, not just a programme requirement. We understand that you might not immediately think it’s going to be fun, or useful, but we aren’t going to continually try to coax you into activity. If necessary, consider how the skills involved will be important for your final grade, for your future career path, or for your general intellectual development. Then throw yourself into it.\nThe bare minimum expectation is to attend Lectures and Labs, to engage with the content, and to allocate independent study hours each and every week. How many hours will be a decision you need to make for yourself, but they are required EVERY week. This module is 25% of the year in terms of module weight, 29% of your year grade, and when combined with your final year dissertation, research contributes 50% of your final grade.\nIt is easy to get sidetracked with Essays during the course of the term. Please consider that those essays contribute 15% of a 15 credit module. The Critical Proposal is worth double that for starters, and your Mini-Dissertation is worth 10X more than any individual essay. Allocating too much time to the 5 essays and falling behind on your Mini-Dissertation is a really poor idea.\nMaterials on the VLE will be considered the ‘baseline’ and you should familiarise yourself with what is available there - it will be everything you need to do really well. We shall be offering ‘extras’ - resources that will support further exploration of a topic, developing further skills, or just interesting added-value content, you will find this under ‘DangerZone’ - these are optional, and if you wish to add anything to these, or suggest some content, please let me know - always happy to help!\nOn this site, resources may include short self-assessment quizzes. Answers are NOT tracked, so use these to test your comprehension, or identify areas for focus.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."

And if you can’t operate effectively in a team, we have to say so. It’s a silly way to miss out on a job. View the process of team work as something that you actively allocate time to. Develop a process. Communicate. Plan. Evaluate.\nIn this module, we suggest a process based in Software Development, called Scrum. There are many variants and nuances, but the key component is a Stand-Up meeting. We propose that you use the first 15 minutes of EVERY lab to run such a meeting. Each team member has 1-2 minutes (VERY SHORT) to cover 3 topics. 1- What did you do last week? 2 - What are you going to do in today’s lab/this week? 3 - Do you anticipate any obstacles or problems?\nThis ensures accountability towards group goals, allows you to clearly identify areas you need to focus on, and to be ready to ask your Lab Tutor any questions that may obstruct your progress. Each week I will be giving a set of reasonable objectives to help you work out where you could/should be. These are obviously flexible, but you should look to make forward progress each and every week.\nIf you choose to use an alternative system to manage your team or your time, fine. But it cannot be replaced with nothing. Your Lab Tutor will be asking to see your plans, and see how you may have allocated tasks or responsibilities. It may sound like a burden, but this is what you will likely have to do with your supervisor next year, and certainly you’ll need these skills in later life. It takes a few minutes a week, but could save you DAYS!"

    "text": "How to prepare for each week in Research Methods\nMany hundreds of years ago, I was a Boy Scout, before that, I was a Brownie too, but that’s a story for another day. ‘Be Prepared’ is a valuable piece of advice.\nAnd that’s what I’m trying to help with here. You aren’t going to get the most out of the timetabled sessions, or your extensive independent study, if you don’t have a fair idea of what you need to do, by when, and what each activity entails.\nYour teaching team goes to a great deal of effort to answer any and all questions you might have, and we engineer the lectures and labs to preview any expected questions and also allow space for questions of the unexpected variety. But you have to ask them. To do this, you need to have a look ahead and identify anything that needs clarification.\nEach week, the Lab Tutors assemble a list of the FAQs from each lab and check to see if any themes are emerging and Gordon will then communicate any relevant answers via the module forum.\nRemember, a lack of preparation on your part is not an emergency on our part. And if you aren’t clear on what you need to do, it’s down to you to review all the VLE page content for information (it will be there), or ask the question via the forum or discuss it with your Lab Tutor in the lab.\nLectures are pretty straightforward. The content will be released on the Wednesday prior to the timetabled session, and will comprise both a prepare summary like this, but also the lecture slides and signposts to key readings. I release these on a Wednesday, as it allows me to incorporate any changes arising from the labs or the previous lecture.\nReview the lecture slides, have a poke around in the readings and try to familiarise yourself with any concepts that may be new to you. But the major point of the lectures is that you come along, pin back your ears, and engage with the content. More on that in the Module Overview.\nYou have a 2 hour lab each week, and although there will be some guided activities and skills shared, these sessions are ‘working sessions’ - designed to allow you to work productively on your Mini-Dissertations individually, or more usually, in your groups. It is expected that you coordinate with your group between classes, it’s not a great use of the session to use that to catch everyone up on things and have a bit of bants. 2 hours of industry will keep you moving through the stages of the module well, reducing the amount of time you might need to work independently, or more realistically, freeing that up for other things you need to prioritise, whether it’s work, life, or love.\nOr walkies with the faithful hound! ta ta G"

    "text": "Key Focus: The core of Science, Effect Sizes and Literature Search and management\n\n\n\nImportant Points:\n\nThe first thing that will happen in the labs this week is we will try to help people who missed last week, or who didn’t manage to find a group, to get settled into a group. If this applies to you, turn up on time (or a bit early) and announce yourself to the Lab Tutor.\nIf you are in a proto-group, you will be asked to complete a form (one per group) that has a group name, the group members (at this time) and anything that you think might be agreed or semi-agreed (general topic, methods you are interested in, working style etc). You will not be instructed to do this, you will be expected to just do this when you arrive.\nWe are going to be keen to help you in concrete ways this year. We are going to be wanting to see things on screen this week; Search Terms, Search Results, Lists of Key Authors etc. Be prepared to let us look over your shoulder, so that we can give feedback, to give you confidence to move forwards. If we don’t see notes or documents, we reserve the right to move on to another student/group and we will come back to you later.\n\nPreparatory Reading or Thinking:\n\nThe core of good scientific practice is asking clear questions and collecting data to answer that question. It sounds easy, but is VERY hard in practice. In the lecture, we shall be touching on experimental hypotheses extraneous and confounding variables and operationalising variables as well as other little gems that are crucial to your success this year.\nI have produced a brief introduction to Effect Sizes, and it can be found here or on the VLE. Please have a read and try to think about what it all means. You will need to be confident with this idea in order to meet the requirements for the Personality Essay and The Critical Proposal. You can discuss this with your Essay Tutor in the tutorial this week too!\nYou are encouraged to read along with the key topics we cover in these first weeks, as it may be that either you don’t immediately connect this with what you have already learned, or that you don’t see why this is important now. If this is the case, I am obviously sorry I didn’t manage to make it clear, as would always be my intention, but the reading list includes Howitt and Cramer Research Methods in Psychology and so Chapters 1 & 2 are worth a skim if this sounds like you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIF YOU ARE STILL UNGROUPED - You will need to make this clear to your Lab Tutor immediately at the start of the session. All students will be asked to detail the members of their groups, and to specify any agreements (Topic, possible methods, ethos, working style) at the start. If you don’t do this it positively hampers our ability to help you. Please take the 10 minutes to do this as fully as possible.\n\n\n\nStudents just arriving must approach the Lab Tutor immediately\nGroup data capture - Please start on this immediately - as much information as possible\nFollow the Worksheet for Literature Searching Tips and exercises\n(Re-)Familiarise yourself with the idea of Effect Sizes and see if you can find one relevant to either academic success or your research topic\nThe Lab Tutor will be circulating and looking at work on screen to see how you are doing.

There is no single process for getting to the point where you feel comfortable answering an essay question or evaluating a journal article for your mini-dissertation.\nThis is where your understanding of your learning, your cognitive needs, your optimal operating window comes into play. If you don’t find this, we can’t give it to you."
