Gullibility study has practical applications within different fields, such as psychology, sociology, marketing, and public policy. The study of factors affecting gullibility has also been conducted to create a precise psychological profile of individuals prone to being gullible. Therefore, emotional intelligence (Baker et al., 2013; Young et al., 2015), social intelligence (Hart et al., 2021; Teunisse et al., 2020) trust (Baker et al., 2013; Hamby et al., 2021; Rotter, 1967; Rotter, 1980; Teunisse et al., 2020: Yamagishi et al., 1999), personality factors (Begue et al., 2015; George et al., 2020; Gore et al., 2012; Peace et al., 2011; Teunisse et al., 2020), facial representation (Jaeger & Meral, 2022) and overall poor decision-making mechanisms have been included.

Gullibility study has practical applications within different fields, such as psychology, sociology, marketing, and public policy. The study of factors affecting gullibility has also been conducted to create a precise psychological profile of individuals prone to being gullible. Therefore, emotional intelligence (Baker et al., 2013; Young et al., 2015), social intelligence (Hart et al., 2021; Teunisse et al., 2020) trust (Baker et al., 2013; Hamby et al., 2021; Rotter, 1967; Rotter, 1980; Teunisse et al., 2020: Yamagishi et al., 1999), personality factors (Begue et al., 2015; George et al., 2020; Gore et al., 2012; Peace et al., 2011; Teunisse et al., 2020), facial representation (Jaeger & Meral, 2022) and overall poor decision-making mechanisms have been included.

    "text": "Here’s some good old text\n\ncleft stuff Gullibility has started to be studied due to the fact it gives valuable insights into human behaviour, cognition, and decision-making processes. Gullibility study has practical applications within different fields, such as psychology, sociology, marketing, and public policy. The study of factors affecting gullibility has also been conducted to create a precise psychological profile of individuals prone to being gullible. Therefore, emotional intelligence (Baker et al., 2013; Young et al., 2015), social intelligence (Hart et al., 2021; Teunisse et al., 2020) trust (Baker et al., 2013; Hamby et al., 2021; Rotter, 1967; Rotter, 1980; Teunisse et al., 2020: Yamagishi et al., 1999), personality factors (Begue et al., 2015; George et al., 2020; Gore et al., 2012; Peace et al., 2011; Teunisse et al., 2020), facial representation (Jaeger & Meral, 2022) and overall poor decision-making mechanisms have been included. The benefit of studying gullibility lies in the need to determine and safeguard individuals who are likely to fall for deceptive speech, online as well as face to face.\n\n\ncright stuff\ntrust (Baker et al., 2013; Hamby et al., 2021; Rotter, 1967; Rotter, 1980; Teunisse et al., 2020: Yamagishi et al., 1999), personality factors (Begue et al., 2015; George et al., 2020; Gore et al., 2012; Peace et al., 2011; Teunisse et al., 2020), facial representation (Jaeger & Meral, 2022) and overall poor decision-making mechanisms have been included.
