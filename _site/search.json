This is the last large-scale piece of group work you’ll do prior to getting a reference.\nStart thinking about how you can search for literature on the topic you have chosen.\nWhat methods are used?

    "text": "Expectation management\nThe teaching team on the module are here because Psychological Research is one of our passions. We teach it to you because we know it to a hugely valuable skill, not just a programme requirement. We understand that you might not immediately think it’s going to be fun, or useful, but we aren’t going to continually try to coax you into activity. If necessary, consider how the skills involved will be important for your final grade, for your future career path, or for your general intellectual development. Then throw yourself into it.\nThe bare minimum expectation is to attend Lectures and Labs, to engage with the content, and to allocate independent study hours each and every week. How many hours will be a decision you need to make for yourself, but they are required EVERY week. This module is 25% of the year in terms of module weight, 29% of your year grade, and when combined with your final year dissertation, research contributes 50% of your final grade.\nIt is easy to get sidetracked with Essays during the course of the term. Please consider that those essays contribute 15% of a 15 credit module. The Critical Proposal is worth double that for starters, and your Mini-Dissertation is worth 10X more than any individual essay. Allocating too much time to the 5 essays and falling behind on your Mini-Dissertation is a really poor idea.\nMaterials on the VLE will be considered the ‘baseline’ and you should familiarise yourself with what is available there - it will be everything you need to do really well. We shall be offering ‘extras’ - resources that will support further exploration of a topic, developing further skills, or just interesting added-value content, you will find this under ‘DangerZone’ - these are optional, and if you wish to add anything to these, or suggest some content, please let me know - always happy to help!\nOn this site, resources may include short self-assessment quizzes. Answers are NOT tracked, so use these to test your comprehension, or identify areas for focus.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."

    "text": "Teamwork\nI bet you just let out a sigh of disgust. Everyone does at the thought of working as a group. But… Do you know the first question on NHS Clinical Doctorate reference requests? Or the first thing that employers usually ask for in Reference Request templates and questionnaires?\n“To what extent is the applicant able to work as part of a team?”\nI kid you not. And if you can’t operate effectively in a team, we have to say so. It’s a silly way to miss out on a job. View the process of team work as something that you actively allocate time to. Develop a process. Communicate. Plan. Evaluate.\nIn this module, we suggest a process based in Software Development, called Scrum. There are many variants and nuances, but the key component is a Stand-Up meeting. We propose that you use the first 15 minutes of EVERY lab to run such a meeting. Each team member has 1-2 minutes (VERY SHORT) to cover 3 topics. 1- What did you do last week? 2 - What are you going to do in today’s lab/this week? 3 - Do you anticipate any obstacles or problems?\nThis ensures accountability towards group goals, allows you to clearly identify areas you need to focus on, and to be ready to ask your Lab Tutor any questions that may obstruct your progress. Each week I will be giving a set of reasonable objectives to help you work out where you could/should be. These are obviously flexible, but you should look to make forward progress each and every week.\nIf you choose to use an alternative system to manage your team or your time, fine. But it cannot be replaced with nothing. Your Lab Tutor will be asking to see your plans, and see how you may have allocated tasks or responsibilities. It may sound like a burden, but this is what you will likely have to do with your supervisor next year, and certainly you’ll need these skills in later life. It takes a few minutes a week, but could save you DAYS!"

Use the resources as a guide, don’t miss anything out, give yourself time. If anything is unclear, ask your Lab Tutor, or ask me. There are no hidden traps on this module. It’s just do some research within the constraints described, and write it up in APA format."

You will see lots of this in action this year, but it is the new gold-standard for scientific publishing and teaching material production, and I have been using it for the last couple of years.\nIf you wonder how to work the slideshows that appear in the VLE like this yourself, here is a cheatsheet. You can navigate with the Arrow keys, and you can get an overview or go fullscreen with O and F respectively. Give it a shot if you are viewing this embedded in the VLE, or choose the RevealJS format in the right hand menu if you are on the website!\n\nI shall be using these exact materials in the lectures and labs, so please feel free to ask any questions, or to ask for any changes.\n\n\n\n\nBecause this system uses markdown (text files) as input, rather than proprietary software formats like PowerPoint, it can be translated and transferred very easily.\nThe first couple of slides looked like this when I wrote them, and I can update them on my phone if I want and publish them to the website automatically in all formats.\n\n\n\n\nThe font I am using is called “Atkinson Hyperlegible” and was developed by the Braille Institute in 2022 to make materials more easily viewed by anyone with impaired vision, dyslexia, or with screen-readers. Have a look here Atkinson Hyperlegible\n\n\n\nI am colour blind and so I have used an app to assess the contrast for all colours used on the site and the materials I produce. I have chosen Viva Magenta as the hero colour for the Lecture Slides and the Website - it was Pantone Colour of the year in 2023. The Lab slides use Veri Peri (Colour of the year 2022).\n\n\n\nOnce we get up and running with the year, I shall bring Dougal (my dog) in to visit, assuming nobody objects. He’s a good boy and I can’t resist sharing a couple of AI generated pictures of him.\n\n\n\nSir Dougal\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceCatDougal!\n\n\n\n\n\nDougal with a laser gun!"

We will talk about R, RStudio and Python a little bit this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlides, worksheets and the Website for the Module are all written using this system.\n\n\n\nIt automatically creates pdf, pptx, docs, html (and more) versions of the material, and is accessible and can combine complex calculations and written work, whether journal articles, presentations, or websites. You will see lots of this in action this year, but it is the new gold-standard for scientific publishing and teaching material production, and I have been using it for the last couple of years.\nIf you wonder how to work the slideshows that appear in the VLE like this yourself, here is a cheatsheet. You can navigate with the Arrow keys, and you can get an overview or go fullscreen with O and F respectively. Give it a shot if you are viewing this embedded in the VLE, or choose the RevealJS format in the right hand menu if you are on the website!\n\nI shall be using these exact materials in the lectures and labs, so please feel free to ask any questions, or to ask for any changes."

    "text": "How to prepare for each week in Research Methods\nMany hundreds of years ago, I was a Boy Scout, before that, I was a Brownie too, but that’s a story for another day. ‘Be Prepared’ is a valuable piece of advice.\nAnd that’s what I’m trying to help with here. You aren’t going to get the most out of the timetabled sessions, or your extensive independent study, if you don’t have a fair idea of what you need to do, by when, and what each activity entails.\nYour teaching team goes to a great deal of effort to answer any and all questions you might have, and we engineer the lectures and labs to preview any expected questions and also allow space for questions of the unexpected variety. But you have to ask them. To do this, you need to have a look ahead and identify anything that needs clarification.\nEach week, the Lab Tutors assemble a list of the FAQs from each lab and check to see if any themes are emerging and Gordon will then communicate any relevant answers via the module forum.\nRemember, a lack of preparation on your part is not an emergency on our part. And if you aren’t clear on what you need to do, it’s down to you to review all the VLE page content for information (it will be there), or ask the question via the forum or discuss it with your Lab Tutor in the lab.\nLectures are pretty straightforward. The content will be released on the Wednesday prior to the timetabled session, and will comprise both a prepare summary like this, but also the lecture slides and signposts to key readings. I release these on a Wednesday, as it allows me to incorporate any changes arising from the labs or the previous lecture.\nReview the lecture slides, have a poke around in the readings and try to familiarise yourself with any concepts that may be new to you. But the major point of the lectures is that you come along, pin back your ears, and engage with the content. More on that in the Module Overview.\nYou have a 2 hour lab each week, and although there will be some guided activities and skills shared, these sessions are ‘working sessions’ - designed to allow you to work productively on your Mini-Dissertations individually, or more usually, in your groups. It is expected that you coordinate with your group between classes, it’s not a great use of the session to use that to catch everyone up on things and have a bit of bants. 2 hours of industry will keep you moving through the stages of the module well, reducing the amount of time you might need to work independently, or more realistically, freeing that up for other things you need to prioritise, whether it’s work, life, or love.\nOr walkies with the faithful hound! ta ta G"

What did you enjoy? What were the problems you faced? How will you address them this time?\nImagine describing how you operated as a team this year to a future supervisor/employer. What would you want to say?\nHere are some thoughts:\n\n\n\nMaintain open, honest, and respectful communication with your team members. Good communication leads to seamless collaboration. Make it as frictionless as possible. Maybe try something like Slack or Jira, specifically for the project, so that you don’t use it for anything but the Mini-Diss. Slack and Jira are almost ubiquitous in modern business, and by having a passing knowledge of them, or being able to name drop them in an interview… boom.\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly define what each team member is responsible for. This eliminates confusion and ensures that everyone is accountable. If you aren’t going to deliver, communicate that fact to your team.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablish realistic deadlines and stick to them. This fosters a sense of urgency and helps you keep the project on track. The Weekly Standup meeting is an ideal way to do this in a short, and slightly longer term.\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilize the diverse skills, experiences, and perspectives within your team to enrich your project. Diversity fosters creativity and problem-solving. Some aspects of the project may be things that you KNOW will be important for you next year… Take responsibility for that and try it on for size.\n\n\n\n\n\nConflicts are inevitable in any team setting. Address issues directly but diplomatically, aiming for a resolution that benefits the team as a whole. And if a team-member disappears… What are you going to do?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter each major milestone, take some time to reflect on what worked well and what didn’t. Adapt your strategies accordingly for future tasks. This might not be until next year, when it really counts, so having these ideas to build on will be amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep records of conversations with your Lab Tutor, decisions you made as a group and individually, and any changes you make along the way. This will not only help you stay organized but will also be useful for future reference, think of it as a love letter to future you.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you’ll not only deliver an exceptional Mini-Dissertation but also gather compelling stories and examples to share with future employers or a supervisor next year. When asked, “How would you work as part of a team” you’ll have a well-rounded, articulate answer that demonstrates your team skills, problem-solving abilities, and commitment to achieving goals.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, please help me assemble a furry research cheer-leading crew and email me a picture of your cat/dog/hamster or anything cute/amusing. And make sure you have your Signature in place. Let’s have a great year!"

    "text": "If you email anyone and they have to look you up on they system to find out your Personal Tutor, or your Student Number, or your Lab Group.. it will slow down responses.\nPlease follow the instructions here Common email functions | Goldsmiths, University of London.\n1 - Log in to your email https://www.gold.ac.uk/it/email/\n2 - Go to Outlook Settings and include the following information in your signature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName, pronouns or preferred name\nStudent Number (8 digits, NOT INCLUDING CARD ISSUE NUMBER e.g. 01)\nYear and Programme (Year 2 - Psychology with Cognitive Neuroscience)\nLab Tutor\nPersonal Tutor\nAny other information that might be useful.\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Challenge!\nResearch Skill Audit\nTopic Speed Dating\nMethods Matching\nGoal Alignment and Group Ethos\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow down, my dude. It’s only Welcome Week. Give me a chance.\nIn weeks to come, this will give you an idea of what you could/should have done by now, and things you may wish to prioritise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Reflection: Think about Team Work you have done before. What did you enjoy? What were the problems you faced? How will you address them this time?\nImagine describing how you operated as a team this year to a future supervisor/employer. What would you want to say?\nHere are some thoughts:\n\n\n\nMaintain open, honest, and respectful communication with your team members. Good communication leads to seamless collaboration. Make it as frictionless as possible. Maybe try something like Slack or Jira, specifically for the project, so that you don’t use it for anything but the Mini-Diss. Slack and Jira are almost ubiquitous in modern business, and by having a passing knowledge of them, or being able to name drop them in an interview… boom.\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly define what each team member is responsible for. This eliminates confusion and ensures that everyone is accountable. If you aren’t going to deliver, communicate that fact to your team.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablish realistic deadlines and stick to them. This fosters a sense of urgency and helps you keep the project on track. The Weekly Standup meeting is an ideal way to do this in a short, and slightly longer term.\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilize the diverse skills, experiences, and perspectives within your team to enrich your project. Diversity fosters creativity and problem-solving. Some aspects of the project may be things that you KNOW will be important for you next year… Take responsibility for that and try it on for size.\n\n\n\n\n\nConflicts are inevitable in any team setting. Address issues directly but diplomatically, aiming for a resolution that benefits the team as a whole. And if a team-member disappears… What are you going to do?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter each major milestone, take some time to reflect on what worked well and what didn’t. Adapt your strategies accordingly for future tasks. This might not be until next year, when it really counts, so having these ideas to build on will be amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep records of conversations with your Lab Tutor, decisions you made as a group and individually, and any changes you make along the way. This will not only help you stay organized but will also be useful for future reference, think of it as a love letter to future you.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you’ll not only deliver an exceptional Mini-Dissertation but also gather compelling stories and examples to share with future employers or a supervisor next year. When asked, “How would you work as part of a team” you’ll have a well-rounded, articulate answer that demonstrates your team skills, problem-solving abilities, and commitment to achieving goals.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, please help me assemble a furry research cheer-leading crew and email me a picture of your cat/dog/hamster or anything cute/amusing. And make sure you have your Signature in place. Let’s have a great year!"
