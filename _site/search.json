    "text": "Key Focus: The core of Science, Effect Sizes and Literature Search and management\n\n\n\n\nImportant Points:\n\nThe first thing that will happen in the labs this week is we will try to help people who missed last week, or who didn’t manage to find a group, to get settled into a group. If this applies to you, turn up on time (or a bit early) and announce yourself to the Lab Tutor.\nIf you are in a proto-group, you will be asked to complete a form (one per group) that has a group name, the group members (at this time) and anything that you think might be agreed or semi-agreed (general topic, methods you are interested in, working style etc). You will not be instructed to do this, you will be expected to just do this when you arrive.\nWe are going to be keen to help you in concrete ways this year. We are going to be wanting to see things on screen this week; Search Terms, Search Results, Lists of Key Authors etc. Be prepared to let us look over your shoulder, so that we can give feedback, to give you confidence to move forwards. If we don’t see notes or documents, we reserve the right to move on to another student/group and we will come back to you later.\n\nPreparatory Reading or Thinking:\n\nThe core of good scientific practice is asking clear questions and collecting data to answer that question. It sounds easy, but is VERY hard in practice. In the lecture, we shall be touching on experimental hypotheses extraneous and confounding variables and operationalising variables as well as other little gems that are crucial to your success this year.\nI have produced a brief introduction to Effect Sizes, and it can be found here or on the VLE. Please have a read and try to think about what it all means. You will need to be confident with this idea in order to meet the requirements for the Personality Essay and The Critical Proposal. You can discuss this with your Essay Tutor in the tutorial this week too!\nYou are encouraged to read along with the key topics we cover in these first weeks, as it may be that either you don’t immediately connect this with what you have already learned, or that you don’t see why this is important now. If this is the case, I am obviously sorry I didn’t manage to make it clear, as would always be my intention, but the reading list includes Howitt and Cramer Research Methods in Psychology and so Chapters 1 & 2 are worth a skim if this sounds like you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIF YOU ARE STILL UNGROUPED - You will need to make this clear to your Lab Tutor immediately at the start of the session. All students will be asked to detail the members of their groups, and to specify any agreements (Topic, possible methods, ethos, working style) at the start. If you don’t do this it positively hampers our ability to help you. Please take the 10 minutes to do this as fully as possible.\n\n\n\nStudents just arriving must approach the Lab Tutor immediately\nGroup data capture - Please start on this immediately - as much information as possible\nFollow the Worksheet for Literature Searching Tips and exercises\n(Re-)Familiarise yourself with the idea of Effect Sizes and see if you can find one relevant to either academic success or your research topic\nThe Lab Tutor will be circulating and looking at work on screen to see how you are doing.

    "text": "How to prepare for each week in Research Methods\nMany hundreds of years ago, I was a Boy Scout, before that, I was a Brownie too, but that’s a story for another day. ‘Be Prepared’ is a valuable piece of advice.\nAnd that’s what I’m trying to help with here. You aren’t going to get the most out of the timetabled sessions, or your extensive independent study, if you don’t have a fair idea of what you need to do, by when, and what each activity entails.\nYour teaching team goes to a great deal of effort to answer any and all questions you might have, and we engineer the lectures and labs to preview any expected questions and also allow space for questions of the unexpected variety. But you have to ask them. To do this, you need to have a look ahead and identify anything that needs clarification.\nEach week, the Lab Tutors assemble a list of the FAQs from each lab and check to see if any themes are emerging and Gordon will then communicate any relevant answers via the module forum.\nRemember, a lack of preparation on your part is not an emergency on our part. And if you aren’t clear on what you need to do, it’s down to you to review all the VLE page content for information (it will be there), or ask the question via the forum or discuss it with your Lab Tutor in the lab.\nLectures are pretty straightforward. The content will be released on the Wednesday prior to the timetabled session, and will comprise both a prepare summary like this, but also the lecture slides and signposts to key readings. I release these on a Wednesday, as it allows me to incorporate any changes arising from the labs or the previous lecture.\nReview the lecture slides, have a poke around in the readings and try to familiarise yourself with any concepts that may be new to you. But the major point of the lectures is that you come along, pin back your ears, and engage with the content. More on that in the Module Overview.\nYou have a 2 hour lab each week, and although there will be some guided activities and skills shared, these sessions are ‘working sessions’ - designed to allow you to work productively on your Mini-Dissertations individually, or more usually, in your groups. It is expected that you coordinate with your group between classes, it’s not a great use of the session to use that to catch everyone up on things and have a bit of bants. 2 hours of industry will keep you moving through the stages of the module well, reducing the amount of time you might need to work independently, or more realistically, freeing that up for other things you need to prioritise, whether it’s work, life, or love.\nOr walkies with the faithful hound! ta ta G",

The only things that will EVER be compulsory are short administrative tasks on a roughly fortnightly basis (group progress update) and the next activity. Otherwise you can use the time as you see fit either alone or in your group, but we know that there is wisdom in the crowd for coming up with topic ideas, identifying cool research ideas and setting the tone for the year ahead.\n\n\n\n\nLab Challenge!

Even if you think you’ve nailed it, let’s discuss it.\n\n\n\nIt is easy to only think about online questionnaires. It may be some of the only research you’ve done, but frankly, it would be a shame to not think more expansively. Some ideas will be discussed, and a discussion about the Lab Challenge might prompt some ideas.\n\n\n\nAnother aspect of effective Group work is Goal Alignment. Even if you are working with your best buddy, they may want to just get in and out, while you want to immerse yourself in the task ahead.\nThis would be a conflict that is potentially dangerous. Think about your goals, your aspirations, and then consider how your might formalise these in to a set of guidelines.\nPlease do take the time to do this.

    "text": "Expectation management\nThe teaching team on the module are here because Psychological Research is one of our passions. We teach it to you because we know it to a hugely valuable skill, not just a programme requirement. We understand that you might not immediately think it’s going to be fun, or useful, but we aren’t going to continually try to coax you into activity. If necessary, consider how the skills involved will be important for your final grade, for your future career path, or for your general intellectual development. Then throw yourself into it.\nThe bare minimum expectation is to attend Lectures and Labs, to engage with the content, and to allocate independent study hours each and every week. How many hours will be a decision you need to make for yourself, but they are required EVERY week. This module is 25% of the year in terms of module weight, 29% of your year grade, and when combined with your final year dissertation, research contributes 50% of your final grade.\nIt is easy to get sidetracked with Essays during the course of the term. Please consider that those essays contribute 15% of a 15 credit module. The Critical Proposal is worth double that for starters, and your Mini-Dissertation is worth 10X more than any individual essay. Allocating too much time to the 5 essays and falling behind on your Mini-Dissertation is a really poor idea.\nMaterials on the VLE will be considered the ‘baseline’ and you should familiarise yourself with what is available there - it will be everything you need to do really well. We shall be offering ‘extras’ - resources that will support further exploration of a topic, developing further skills, or just interesting added-value content, you will find this under ‘DangerZone’ - these are optional, and if you wish to add anything to these, or suggest some content, please let me know - always happy to help!\nOn this site, resources may include short self-assessment quizzes. Answers are NOT tracked, so use these to test your comprehension, or identify areas for focus.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."

    "text": "Teamwork\nI bet you just let out a sigh of disgust. Everyone does at the thought of working as a group. But… Do you know the first question on NHS Clinical Doctorate reference requests? Or the first thing that employers usually ask for in Reference Request templates and questionnaires?\n“To what extent is the applicant able to work as part of a team?”\nI kid you not. And if you can’t operate effectively in a team, we have to say so. It’s a silly way to miss out on a job. View the process of team work as something that you actively allocate time to. Develop a process. Communicate. Plan. Evaluate.\nIn this module, we suggest a process based in Software Development, called Scrum. There are many variants and nuances, but the key component is a Stand-Up meeting. We propose that you use the first 15 minutes of EVERY lab to run such a meeting. Each team member has 1-2 minutes (VERY SHORT) to cover 3 topics. 1- What did you do last week? 2 - What are you going to do in today’s lab/this week? 3 - Do you anticipate any obstacles or problems?\nThis ensures accountability towards group goals, allows you to clearly identify areas you need to focus on, and to be ready to ask your Lab Tutor any questions that may obstruct your progress. Each week I will be giving a set of reasonable objectives to help you work out where you could/should be. These are obviously flexible, but you should look to make forward progress each and every week.\nIf you choose to use an alternative system to manage your team or your time, fine. But it cannot be replaced with nothing. Your Lab Tutor will be asking to see your plans, and see how you may have allocated tasks or responsibilities. It may sound like a burden, but this is what you will likely have to do with your supervisor next year, and certainly you’ll need these skills in later life. It takes a few minutes a week, but could save you DAYS!"

Use the resources as a guide, don’t miss anything out, give yourself time. If anything is unclear, ask your Lab Tutor, or ask me. There are no hidden traps on this module. It’s just do some research within the constraints described, and write it up in APA format."

    "section": "Method",
    "text": "Method\nThe method section is where you describe how you conducted your study. An important principle for writing a method section is that it should be clear and detailed enough that other researchers could replicate the study by following your “recipe.” This means that it must describe all the important elements of the study—basic demographic characteristics of the participants, how they were recruited, whether they were randomly assigned, how the variables were manipulated or measured, how counterbalancing was accomplished, and so on. At the same time, it should avoid irrelevant details such as the fact that the study was conducted in Classroom 37B of the Industrial Technology Building or that the questionnaire was double-sided and completed using mechanical pencils.\nThe method section begins immediately after the introduction ends with the heading “Method” (not “Methods” - I’m always making that mistake!) centered on the page. Immediately after this is the subheading “Participants,” left justified and in italics. The participants subsection indicates how many participants there were, the number of male, female and other/prefer not to say (or any response options you offered), some indication of their age, other demographics that may be relevant to the study, and how they were recruited, including any incentives given for participation.\n\n\n\nAPA Style and the Values of Psychology\n\n\nRobert Madigan and his colleagues have argued that APA style has a purpose that often goes unrecognized (Madigan et al., 1995). Specifically, it promotes psychologists’ scientific values and assumptions. From this perspective, many features of APA style that at first seem arbitrary actually make good sense. Following are several features of APA-style writing and the scientific values or assumptions they reflect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA style feature\nScientific value or assumption\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few direct quotations of other researchers.\nThe phenomena and theories of psychology are objective and do not depend on the specific words a particular researcher used to describe them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriticisms are directed at other researchers’ work but not at them personally.\nThe focus of scientific research is on drawing general conclusions about the world, not on the personalities of particular researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many references and reference citations.\nScientific research is a large-scale collaboration among many researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical research reports are organized with specific sections in a fixed order.\nThere is an ideal approach to conducting empirical research in psychology (even if this ideal is not always achieved in actual research).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers tend to “hedge” their conclusions, e.g., “The results suggest that…”\nScientific knowledge is tentative and always subject to revision based on new empirical results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose of the Method Section\n\nThe Method section is crucial for allowing others to replicate your study, ensuring the reliability and validity of your research findings.\nA well-documented Method section demonstrates your thorough understanding of research methodologies, earning you credibility and potentially higher marks.\n\nOverview of APA 7 Formatting\n\nAPA7 emphasizes clarity, precision, and a bias-free language in research writing. The simple way of understanding if a Method section is complete and effective is to ask yourself, “Could Gordon take my Method section (and Open Materials) and replicate my study perfectly?”. Don’t include obvious information, such as the colour of ink in pens or stuff I could figure out. Just the important information!\nConsistency in formatting, such as headings, font, and citation style (APA7), is key. If you are unclear on the appropriate format, either use the template Gordon has provided, or refer to apastyle.org for numerous examples.\nUse past tense to describe the methods used: “Participants were asked…”, “The study used…”. You have completed the study after all.\n\nA previous edition of the Publication Manual strongly discouraged the use of the term subjects (except for nonhumans) and strongly encouraged the use of participants instead. But it also encourages the use of more specific terms when possible: college students, children, respondents, and so on. If in doubt, refer to PARTICIPANTS!\nTable 2 (below) contains some of the most common types of APA style errors based on an analysis of manuscripts submitted to one professional journal over a 6-year period [Onwuegbuzie et al. (2010)]. These errors were committed by professional researchers but are probably similar to those that students commit the most too. See also Note “[O]” in this section and, of course, the Publication Manual itself.\n\n\n\nTop 10 APA-Style Errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError type\nExample\n\n\n\n\n1. Use of numbers\nFailing to use numerals for 10 and above\n\n\n2. Hyphenation\nFailing to hyphenate compound adjectives that precede a noun (e.g., “role playing technique” should be “role-playing technique”)\n\n\n3. Use of et al.\nFailing to use it in a reference\n\n\n4. Headings\nNot capitalizing headings correctly\n\n\n5. Use of since\nUsing since to mean because\n\n\n6. Tables and figures\nNot formatting them in APA style; repeating information that is already given in the text\n\n\n7. Use of commas\nFailing to use a comma before and or or in a series of three or more elements\n\n\n8. Use of abbreviations\nFailing to spell out a term completely before introducing an abbreviation for it\n\n\n9. Spacing\nNot consistently double-spacing between lines\n\n\n10. Use of & in references\nUsing & in the text or and in parentheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline APA Style Resources again 🤓\n\n\nThe best source of information on APA style is the Publication Manual itself. However, there are also many good websites on APA style, which do an excellent job of presenting the basics for beginning researchers.

The Method section is not just a procedural description but a showcase of your meticulous planning and execution of research, adhering to the principles of Open Science by also attaching an Open Materials submission (to be covered later in detail).\n\n\n\nThe method section is where you describe how you conducted your study. An important principle for writing a method section is that it should be clear and detailed enough that other researchers could replicate the study by following your “recipe.” This means that it must describe all the important elements of the study—basic demographic characteristics of the participants, how they were recruited, whether they were randomly assigned, how the variables were manipulated or measured, how counterbalancing was accomplished, and so on. At the same time, it should avoid irrelevant details such as the fact that the study was conducted in Classroom 37B of the Industrial Technology Building or that the questionnaire was double-sided and completed using mechanical pencils.\nThe method section begins immediately after the introduction ends with the heading “Method” (not “Methods” - I’m always making that mistake!) centered on the page. Immediately after this is the subheading “Participants,” left justified and in italics. The participants subsection indicates how many participants there were, the number of male, female and other/prefer not to say (or any response options you offered), some indication of their age, other demographics that may be relevant to the study, and how they were recruited, including any incentives given for participation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA Style and the Values of Psychology\n\n\n\nRobert Madigan and his colleagues have argued that APA style has a purpose that often goes unrecognized (Madigan et al., 1995).

    "text": "The method section is where you describe how you conducted your study. An important principle for writing a method section is that it should be clear and detailed enough that other researchers could replicate the study by following your “recipe.” This means that it must describe all the important elements of the study—basic demographic characteristics of the participants, how they were recruited, whether they were randomly assigned, how the variables were manipulated or measured, how counterbalancing was accomplished, and so on. At the same time, it should avoid irrelevant details such as the fact that the study was conducted in Classroom 37B of the Industrial Technology Building or that the questionnaire was double-sided and completed using mechanical pencils.\nThe method section begins immediately after the introduction ends with the heading “Method” (not “Methods” - I’m always making that mistake!) centered on the page. Immediately after this is the subheading “Participants,” left justified and in italics. The participants subsection indicates how many participants there were, the number of male, female and other/prefer not to say (or any response options you offered), some indication of their age, other demographics that may be relevant to the study, and how they were recruited, including any incentives given for participation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA Style and the Values of Psychology\n\n\n\nRobert Madigan and his colleagues have argued that APA style has a purpose that often goes unrecognized (Madigan et al., 1995). Specifically, it promotes psychologists’ scientific values and assumptions. From this perspective, many features of APA style that at first seem arbitrary actually make good sense. Following are several features of APA-style writing and the scientific values or assumptions they reflect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA style feature\nScientific value or assumption\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few direct quotations of other researchers.\nThe phenomena and theories of psychology are objective and do not depend on the specific words a particular researcher used to describe them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriticisms are directed at other researchers’ work but not at them personally.\nThe focus of scientific research is on drawing general conclusions about the world, not on the personalities of particular researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many references and reference citations.\nScientific research is a large-scale collaboration among many researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical research reports are organized with specific sections in a fixed order.\nThere is an ideal approach to conducting empirical research in psychology (even if this ideal is not always achieved in actual research).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers tend to “hedge” their conclusions, e.g., “The results suggest that…”\nScientific knowledge is tentative and always subject to revision based on new empirical results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Method section is crucial for allowing others to replicate your study, ensuring the reliability and validity of your research findings.\nA well-documented Method section demonstrates your thorough understanding of research methodologies, earning you credibility and potentially higher marks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA7 emphasizes clarity, precision, and a bias-free language in research writing. The simple way of understanding if a Method section is complete and effective is to ask yourself, “Could Gordon take my Method section (and Open Materials) and replicate my study perfectly?”. Don’t include obvious information, such as the colour of ink in pens or stuff I could figure out. Just the important information!\nConsistency in formatting, such as headings, font, and citation style (APA7), is key. If you are unclear on the appropriate format, either use the template Gordon has provided, or refer to apastyle.org for numerous examples.\nUse past tense to describe the methods used: “Participants were asked…”, “The study used…”. You have completed the study after all.\n\nA previous edition of the Publication Manual strongly discouraged the use of the term subjects (except for nonhumans) and strongly encouraged the use of participants instead. But it also encourages the use of more specific terms when possible: college students, children, respondents, and so on. If in doubt, refer to PARTICIPANTS!\nTable 2 (below) contains some of the most common types of APA style errors based on an analysis of manuscripts submitted to one professional journal over a 6-year period [Onwuegbuzie et al. (2010)]. These errors were committed by professional researchers but are probably similar to those that students commit the most too. See also Note “[O]” in this section and, of course, the Publication Manual itself.\n\n\n\nTop 10 APA-Style Errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError type\nExample\n\n\n\n\n1. Use of numbers\nFailing to use numerals for 10 and above\n\n\n2. Hyphenation\nFailing to hyphenate compound adjectives that precede a noun (e.g., “role playing technique” should be “role-playing technique”)\n\n\n3. Use of et al.\nFailing to use it in a reference\n\n\n4. Headings\nNot capitalizing headings correctly\n\n\n5. Use of since\nUsing since to mean because\n\n\n6. Tables and figures\nNot formatting them in APA style; repeating information that is already given in the text\n\n\n7. Use of commas\nFailing to use a comma before and or or in a series of three or more elements\n\n\n8. Use of abbreviations\nFailing to spell out a term completely before introducing an abbreviation for it\n\n\n9. Spacing\nNot consistently double-spacing between lines\n\n\n10. Use of & in references\nUsing & in the text or and in parentheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline APA Style Resources again 🤓\n\n\n\nThe best source of information on APA style is the Publication Manual itself. However, there are also many good websites on APA style, which do an excellent job of presenting the basics for beginning researchers. Here are two of them.\nAPA Style: http://www.apastyle.apa.org\nPurdue Online Writing Lab: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html"

I’ll delve into the essentials of APA 7, highlighting its guiding principles and how it underpins the structure and presentation of your research.\nAlthough the structure and format of an APA 7 dissertation may seem restrictive and somewhat artificial, it’s designed to be consistent across journal articles and dissertations. There’s a huge amount of support available online to which I point to you below where you can look for information on stylistic elements and tone of voice.\nOn the topic of tone of voice, the biggest mistake that we see every year is people trying to adopt an overly complex or unnatural tone of voice. This is not the goal of APA style. Your goal should be to speak in a technically advanced manner but that is accessible to an intelligent reader. This will be primarily in the third person, so not using ‘I’ or ‘my’. The only exception to this will be in the reflective account that comes after your references and is NOT included in the word-count. So spend some time thinking about how best to phrase any of the key terms in your dissertation (Variables, Conditions, Concepts etc) and stick to it. Be consistent, find the best way of saying it and use that rather than varying your terminology for the sake of variety.\nPlease review the comprehensive information on APA conventions and grammar/style at APAStyle.org - from the horse’s mouth, so to speak… APA Format and Grammar Guidelines"

    "text": "The Rationale for APA 7 Formatting\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA) 7th edition formatting isn’t just about adhering to needless conventions; it’s about clarity, consistency, and presenting information in a way that is technically proficient and accessible to intelligent readers, whether psychologists or not! I’ll delve into the essentials of APA 7, highlighting its guiding principles and how it underpins the structure and presentation of your research.\nAlthough the structure and format of an APA 7 dissertation may seem restrictive and somewhat artificial, it’s designed to be consistent across journal articles and dissertations. There’s a huge amount of support available online to which I point to you below where you can look for information on stylistic elements and tone of voice.\nOn the topic of tone of voice, the biggest mistake that we see every year is people trying to adopt an overly complex or unnatural tone of voice. This is not the goal of APA style. Your goal should be to speak in a technically advanced manner but that is accessible to an intelligent reader. This will be primarily in the third person, so not using ‘I’ or ‘my’. The only exception to this will be in the reflective account that comes after your references and is NOT included in the word-count. So spend some time thinking about how best to phrase any of the key terms in your dissertation (Variables, Conditions, Concepts etc) and stick to it. Be consistent, find the best way of saying it and use that rather than varying your terminology for the sake of variety.\nPlease review the comprehensive information on APA conventions and grammar/style at APAStyle.org - from the horse’s mouth, so to speak… APA Format and Grammar Guidelines"

It demands ‘double hermeneutics’\n\nMethodology:\n\nInvolves detailed, reflective examinations of participants’ lived experiences.\nTypically uses small, purposively selected samples to provide in-depth insights.\nData is usually collected through semi-structured interviews or personal diaries."

A brief overview of valuable resources is available.\n\nWork with your group to identify which elements of your study (measures, questionnaires, tasks) are shared and which are individual. This will allow you to start considering how to combine your energies to best effect in developing materials.\nMost, if not all, of you, will use Qualtrics. There are some useful tools and tips to help you get up and running. Import the Mini-Dissertation Template and get to work building your study. For more complex tasks, Gorilla will be what you need.\nGordon’s Top Tip: Time spent preparing your materials really pays off – in terms of time, data quality, and confidence!\n\n\n\n\nMoving towards your individual research question: In your groups, and with your Critical Proposals in mind, discuss your projects. Do you all still agree on your original research question or how you thought you’d explore it? Have your ideas developed in any way? List your preferred IVs, DVs, and methodologies and compare notes. Look out for similarities and differences.\nIt is normal that your approaches or interests may diverge a little as a result of your critical evaluations. This is great. If not, that’s fine too. The design of your individual Mini-Dissertation needs to be slightly different from your collaborators, so you can pursue your interests if they differ somewhat.\nExploring different personality traits is a nice way to find distinctive IVs. If you are presenting stimulus materials, you could present different types, classes, or categories. An exploration of memory may include familiar or unfamiliar words, short or long words, or focus on another type of stimulus, such as numbers or shapes, different presentation durations, or recall delays. Or you could use different DVs, such as accuracy/error rate, or reaction time, or confidence; all interesting. If you are looking at life-outcomes as a DV (as many of you are), these can vary by domain (e.g. work or home-life) or how you quantify them; how do you quantify success or happiness or health? It may initially seem quite tricky to see how this might work, but your lab tutor is on hand to help!\nSharing the workload: Following on from the question above, is there a ‘central’ task, measure, or stimulus-set in your project that potentially requires more effort to find or build? Does some aspect of your project involve the selection or creation of stimulus material?\nThis might be a good thing to develop as a group, allowing you to make it as effective as possible. This is likely the core of your methods section and worth making fabulous. You can then duplicate this component and break into smaller groups to tailor it and collect the data if you need to or want to. But by working together as much as possible, you can refine this component and make it as accurate and impressive as possible with relative ease.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease go to this link: Goldsmiths Qualtrics\nUse your college email address and password. To get the full functionality, you MUST use your college login.\n\nIf you accidentally set up a trial account, or use a different email, it can take 3 weeks to change. Follow these instructions on the VLE: VLE Instructions\nYou will know if you have been successful if, when you log in, the URL starts with goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the Mini-Dissertation Qualtrics Template HERE or from the VLE page.\nIt will be a .qsf file, native to Qualtrics, and will only open in Qualtrics.\nTo use the template, on the Homepage, click on ‘Create a new project’, select ‘Survey’, and ‘Get started’.\n\nGive your project a preliminary name (this can be changed later) and choose ‘Import a QSF file’ from the ‘How you want to start’ dropdown.\n\nFind the .qsf file you downloaded earlier using the ‘Choose file’ finder and then click ‘Create project’.\nYou will likely be offered the option to ‘Take a tour’ of the Survey Builder. It takes two minutes and shows you how to change settings and to edit questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease notice that, over and above the survey questions, the template includes four important elements; 1) an Information Sheet outlining the study, 2) Informed Consent, 3) GDPR, and 4) a Debrief delivered at the end of the survey.\nYou are required to submit copies of the information you supply in these sections in word doc format with your Ethics Application for storage on file. Simply copy the content in the relevant sections of your Qualtrics survey into 4 separate word documents for submission.\nNB: If you run an experiment in person (this year OR next), you will be required to give each participant a hard copy of all of these documents and retain a signed Consent Form for your records. The process of developing these materials is valuable preparation - please be involved.\nOnce you’ve created your survey, you’re ready to start building. This page outlines how to add, delete, copy, and edit multiple questions in the Survey tab to build your required functionality. The Qualtrics help is extremely useful and gives extensive, easily-navigable help.\nFor example, you will want to add new questions into the body of the survey, corresponding with demographic information or a psychometric measure or questionnaire you have found.\n\n\n\nThis page is very useful to help select the best question type. There are many types, but you will find Matrix Tables, Multiple Choice, and Sliders particularly useful. You can present images, media and text by using the Text/Graphic options and Rich Text Editor.\n\nCreating New Questions in Qualtrics\n\nTry to make the questions as easy to navigate as possible. Remember to use page breaks to make the flow more enjoyable.\n\nAdding Page Breaks Manually\n\nYou can use a Rich Content Editor to include more elaborate instructions and adding media or graphics. You can also use hyperlinks to connect to content on the web outside of your questionnaire. You might want to include a downloadable file, such as a debrief form or pdf of some information you think a participant may want to retain. This can be managed via the Rich Content Editor. Making a participant feel like they have learned something can be a powerful reward. Please be careful not to break copyright by sharing materials you haven’t produced yourself. If you propose to include such materials, this should be included in your Ethics Application.\n\n\n\nPlease only use your Goldsmiths Email address when running research and if you give your own details ALWAYS supply those of your Lab Tutor or the Module Coordinator. This affords you some protection and allows us to help deal with any questions.\nIt is important that you clearly outline recruitment strategies in your ethic application (i.e. how you propose to recruit and where you share your task) and you must ONLY share an approved task.\n\n\n\n\nBlock Options and Randomization\n\nSets of questions (or entire questionnaires) can be set up as ‘blocks’ within your survey. If you wish to randomize these blocks, you can, meaning that you can randomly shuffle the sequence of presentation. This is an important feature that you may wish to consider using. Obviously, the information and informed consent will need to remain at the start and the debrief needs to always be the last block presented.\nIn the ‘survey flow’ area, you will see that you can view the blocks in the survey and add a randomizer, that randomly delivers a selection of blocks. Block 1 and 2 are identical in the template, but will be presented in random order for each new participant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have set up your survey, it is always a good idea to run a test and export the data to make sure it is in the format that you require. If you notice that the data are not in the format you would most easily use, it may be that you could consider ‘recoding’ the values to make it easier to use.\n\nRecode Values in Qualtrics\n\n\n\n\n\nScoring can save you LOTS of time, by automatically scoring your questionnaires or subscales of your questionnaires. Consider using this if your measure generates a total score or you are planning on calculating an average etc. It is perfectly easy to calculate these in excel, but it can be done automatically with a little care and preparation.\n\nScoring in Qualtrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see how a question (or entire survey) looks, use the preview functionality. It will allow you to see what the participant will see – both on a computer and on a mobile device.\n\n\n\n\nIt is highly recommended that you test how the data will be exported from your survey, so that you can perfect how you label your questions and how you recode or score your variables. To run a quick ‘data test’ do the following.\nClick Publish and label the versions ‘Data Test’ and click ‘Publish’ again.\n\nUnder ‘Distributions’ select ‘Anonymous link’ (which is how you will share your study with participants usually. You can of course produce a QR code or use Bit.ly to shorten the link to make it more attractive. Think about the best way to recruit for your study.\nCopy the link to your browser and run through the study.\n\nExport Data from this menu to a range of useful formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Term 2 we will be looking at the data and how to clean it. The most important thing I would advise you to do is to name your blocks and questions clearly, so that this is reflected in the dataset that you download. If you don’t know which question is which, you could come unstuck.\n\n\n\nIf you wish to share your survey with your group and work on it together, you can ‘Collaborate’ the project. It’s like using a shared document. You can monitor versions in case you make a mistake, but remember to ‘Publish’ if you want to over-write any changes you make! You can find this in the ‘Tools’ menu and you will need to use your colleagues’ Goldsmiths email addresses AND they will need to have a Goldsmiths Qualtrics account too.\n\nFor More Information the Qualtrics website includes comprehensive and easy-to-follow help documentation as mentioned above. Tutorials, webinars and detailed directions are available via Qualtrics’ extensive online resource, Qualtrics Support. www.qualtrics.com/support\nFor fast, individualized support over chat, email or a scheduled phone call, please consider using the Support Center.

You’ve critically evaluated research to inform your own approach to the topic. You’ve probably identified useful measures and tasks to use in your studies. Now is the time to start developing your studies for real.\nSome of your studies may comprise questionnaire measures and other demographic or participant details. Some may involve more complex behavioural tasks. Even in person studies might benefit from using Qualtrics or a computerised task.\nBear in mind that you need to have completed building these BEFORE you apply for ethics later this term. Once your materials are approved, they can’t be changed. Now is the time to make them as effective as possible in terms of the research question, but also as user-friendly as possible – for you AND the participants. The quality of these materials will directly impact the quality of your data.\nThere will be some pragmatic decisions that you make, such as identifying economical measures for variables of interest. A study that is too time-consuming will be unattractive and you are required to estimate how long a study takes to complete to participants before they take part. Always consider the user experience. There is no requirement that your study is long and complicated. This is a modest first research study. There is no benefit to long and complicated!\nAnd you should consider how user-friendly your materials are for participants and experimenter alike. Try to make the materials you employ appear professional and attractive. You will be submitting your materials and they will be appraised for professionalism and presentation. But thinking of yourself next term, the easier it is to output your data and begin your analysis, the better.\nTake the time to label your questions clearly and verify the data outputs in an intelligible format. We will cover this in later labs, but why not poke around in advance and ensure it’s a smooth process! Take the time to recode variables into output that you can use easily. And use ‘Scoring’ to give you automatically produced means, totals and subscales wherever possible. It will save you time and worry in Term 2!\nSimply put; being as confident in your materials as possible will save you time and increase your confidence in the New Year (and Next Year!)\nLooking forward to Third Year: Data collection and management as valuable skills\nYou might think that something like Qualtrics isn’t a hugely valuable skill to learn. Well, in a high proportion of cases you’ll use it next year for your Final Year Dissertation, and being confident doing that is worthwhile in itself.\nBut you’d be amazed how common it is nowadays to want to survey opinion or attitudes. Imagine you are running a business and want to find out what your customers think about your product. Imagine you are managing an organization and need to understand how much time your employees spend on unnecessarily difficult tasks, or how they rate you as a boss.\nAsking questions using surveys is a quick way to generate important insights, but not as easy as people think. Being able to design good questions, and delivering them well, is a valuable skill.\nAnd once you have lots of lovely data, being able to manage those data well enough to allow you to extract the important insights hiding within is something that very few people are able to do well… You’ll be expert at such things.\nI’ve already mentioned that Excel (or Numbers or Google Sheets) are incredibly common tools you’ll probably use on a regular basis in your future lives. Contact lists, customer databases, financial results and accounts, stock inventories, meta-data, Gannt charts and the list goes on. We are training you in important skills here!\nBeing confident manipulating and presenting data – Data Literacy - is something you will likely wish to highlight on future CVs and you can begin to develop those skills in your Mini-Dissertation, and refine and perfect them next year. Being confident with data will allow you to think bigger about your Final Year Dissertation than if you are worried about this.\nMany of you will be anxious about ‘statistics’. I’d hope, in due course, that your experience this year will help to allay those fears. But I believe the biggest anxiety students experience around ‘statistics’ isn’t the statistics part of it at all. I believe that moving from raw data to an analysis-ready dataset is the intimidating bit, not the few button presses in SPSS. For this reason, we have oodles of support in Term 2 around how to prepare, clean, and screen your data, so that you can unleash all the SPSS skills you’ve been learning in Design & Analysis with zero stress.\nHave a great week."

    "section": "Working Out How to Start Developing Your Study",
    "text": "Working Out How to Start Developing Your Study\n\nMoving towards your individual research question: In your groups, and with your Critical Proposals in mind, discuss your projects. Do you all still agree on your original research question or how you thought you’d explore it? Have your ideas developed in any way? List your preferred IVs, DVs, and methodologies and compare notes. Look out for similarities and differences.\nIt is normal that your approaches or interests may diverge a little as a result of your critical evaluations. This is great. If not, that’s fine too. The design of your individual Mini-Dissertation needs to be slightly different from your collaborators, so you can pursue your interests if they differ somewhat.\nExploring different personality traits is a nice way to find distinctive IVs. If you are presenting stimulus materials, you could present different types, classes, or categories. An exploration of memory may include familiar or unfamiliar words, short or long words, or focus on another type of stimulus, such as numbers or shapes, different presentation durations, or recall delays. Or you could use different DVs, such as accuracy/error rate, or reaction time, or confidence; all interesting. If you are looking at life-outcomes as a DV (as many of you are), these can vary by domain (e.g. work or home-life) or how you quantify them; how do you quantify success or happiness or health? It may initially seem quite tricky to see how this might work, but your lab tutor is on hand to help!\nSharing the workload: Following on from the question above, is there a ‘central’ task, measure, or stimulus-set in your project that potentially requires more effort to find or build? Does some aspect of your project involve the selection or creation of stimulus material?\nThis might be a good thing to develop as a group, allowing you to make it as effective as possible. This is likely the core of your methods section and worth making fabulous. You can then duplicate this component and break into smaller groups to tailor it and collect the data if you need to or want to. But by working together as much as possible, you can refine this component and make it as accurate and impressive as possible with relative ease."

    "text": "This week has two major areas of focus - a deeper dive on the Ethics Application Portal, including information that will be required, and to recap Psychometric Reliability and Validity.\n\n\nThis week is focussed on the following overarching learning objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe fully prepared to submit a successful Ethics Application\nUnderstand and be able to critically assess the strengths and limitations of psychological measures in terms of their reliability and validity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivities for this week\n\n\n\n\nEthics Portal information deep dive\nPsychometric Reliability and Validity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamiliarise yourself with the important Ethics resources available on the VLE. These include general Research guidelines, but some specific to online research too (should you plan to work online only).\nSuccessfully logging in to the Research Ethics portal and reviewing all the information you will be required to submit in support of your ethics application. By being aware of this, you can offset any problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease pay close attention to detail\n\n\n\nAny errors will result in an application being returned and a resubmission will be required.\n\n\nThe Ethics Committee VLE page. https://learn.gold.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=17220\nResources on the Research Methods VLE page https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1410090\nBritish Psychological Society Code of Human Research Ethics \nThis document outlines the general principles of ethical research with human participants.\nBritish Psychological Society Ethics guidelines for internet mediated research (Online Research)\nThis document details requirements for online testing\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation - GDPR - What is ‘personal data’\nGDPR is legislation which protects participant data and must be adhered to at all times. If you propose to collect ‘personal data’ (see link for definition) it brings with it the responsibility to treat it with the utmost integrity and security.\n\n\n\nAll Undergraduate and Postgraduate student projects (e.g., Y2 UG Mini-Dissertation, Y3 project, MSc project, PhD research) are submitted via the online ethics system.\nFor the Mini-Dissertation, you need to complete an ethical application for each individual study advertised to participants. If a single study is the combined efforts of multiple students, and collects data for a number of Mini-Dissertations, it only need ethical approval once, but you must list ALL students involved. All students should be familiar with the ethical considerations of their study and have been involved in the process of making the application.  \nEvery individual student must have applied for ethics, or have been named on an ethics application, in order to pass the module.\n\n\n\nThe ethics system can be accessed through the departmental student dashboard: https://psy770.gold.ac.uk/student There are two steps to log in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you click on the link a pop-up box will appear, you need to enter the following:\nUsername: student\nPassword: goldpsy\nYou will then be asked to use your normal username and password to access your personal ethics portal:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the appropriate project type, choose the current year, and give the application a meaningful name (unlike Best Mini-Dissertation EVER!). Consider something along the lines of ‘The effect of personality and chronotype on Imposter Syndrome in higher education’. Informative and clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour ‘Supervisor’ will be your Lab Tutor.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have done this, your application will be available to edit, view, upload supporting documents, view comments, view messages from the committee or your supervisor, or delete (if necessary).\n\nClick edit to start completing the form. The first item you will see is ‘co-applicants’. It is normal that a single student may take the lead on drafting the ethics application, but all students who will obtain data from the task must be listed. Please make sure that this is complete. In order to pass the module, all students must be listed in a successful ethics application.\nI have added Ian Hannent (our Department Systems Engineer) as my co-applicant. Do this for all the students for whom the proposed study will provide data, and only those students. You can find a list of current students in the dropdown box.\nPlease contact your lab tutor if your name does not appear on the list!\n\n\nYou are then presented with 15 questions to which you must respond Yes, No or Not Applicable (N/A). Please read these carefully and respond correctly.\nBy responding Yes to any questions beyond question 11 will usually require you to complete a ’Box B’ application, meaning that extra information will be required to ensure full compliance and safety. YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE A CATEGORY B APPLICATION. If you feel that you need to answer YES to any question after 11… Reconsider.\n\nIt is common that you may conceal a little about the study in the information sheet in order to avoid contaminating results. This is misleading a participant, in that it is NOT fully informed consent. This can however be offset by giving a very clear debrief and telling the participant what you did and why in that debrief. I believe this is one of the more common queries. In second place is a query as to what constitutes distress or discomfort.\nIf the topic of your research raises a topic or concept that may in any way be upsetting or worrying to a participant, address this very clearly in the debrief. I do work on deception and psychopathy, and either of those topics could be upsetting to an individual who has been victim to deceit, or who hears about psychopaths for the first time. I would always give a very clear source of further information AND support that participants can follow up if they need. I believe this is just good practice.\n When the Online Data Collection box is selected, you will see the following questions.\nAs noted in the lab slides, you have to submit a link to a COMPLETE, published version of your task for review if you plan to collect data solely online.\nFor questions 1 – 9 you must give a short answer as to how these objectives will be achieved.\n\nSelect A if you consider your application without any ethical concerns - For the purposes of your Mini-Dissertation, you are required to submit a category A application. As noted above. If you feel you are entering Category B territory - think again.\n\nProvide short, but detailed responses to the questions below. These are not ‘marked’ but failure to give complete information will result in a request for resubmission.\nWhat you are trying to find out and the justification for asking the question. An ethical research project has a worthwhile and meaningful objective.  \n\nGive an overview of the various parts of your study, perhaps in order to help the reviewer, with details of the measures involved. If you are using a standardised questionnaire, say so WITH REFERENCE. If you have created questions yourself, say so.\n\nInsert a short summary of your power calculation and estimated sample size. Give specific details of how you propose to advertise the study and where and any pre-requisites around demographics or exclusion/inclusion criteria. Please be specific. If you wish to advertise your study on social media please specify the types of channels or audiences being targeted in case it may be problematic. For example, recruiting participants of a particular characteristic by entering an online community uninvited may be upsetting to its members. Consider any potentially damaging effects for would-be participants, even from just an invitation to participate in research.\n\nPlease reiterate here the process of informed consent, debriefing and any use of identifying information (such as email addresses or identifiers).\n\nInclude the dates as relevant and upload copies of the Information Sheet, Informed Consent questions, GDPR and debrief. This should be IDENTICAL to the information in your online task (if you use one), so copy it from there into separate word documents. This will be stored on file.\n\n\n\nYou can save the form at any time and come back to it. Once you have completed all the questions and uploaded the documents, you will be able to submit the form using the Submit button at the bottom of the form.\n\n\n\nOnce submitted the form goes to your supervisor (lab Tutor) to review, and the status changes to ‘With Supervisor’.\nYou will not be able to edit the form at this stage. Your supervisor will then review the form, and will send you a message through this system if any changes are needed. It is important that all messages about this form are sent through the system, to avoid confusion.\nIf the supervisor has requested changes they will send the form back to you, the status changes to ‘With Student’ and you will be able to edit and then submit again.\nOnce the supervisor has approved the form, the status will change to ‘Being Processed by Ethics Committee’.\nAny amendments will be requested by the Committee through this system, and the form will be returned to you for amendment.\nOnce approval has been granted an automatic email will be sent to you. There is nothing we can do to hurry applications. Turnaround is anticipated to be 1 week, but obviously, if everyone submits on the same day, this is impossible. If you have been waiting for more than 2 weeks, please alert your lab tutor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is some wider reading - not an activity per se\n\n\n\nAny Research Methods textbook will cover these 4 validites and 4 reliabilities (and more) in excruciating detail, but below are some general thoughts to help you think about this important topic\nRemember - your mini-dissertation doesn’t need to incorporate all of these, but you should be thinking carefully about ensuring quality along these dimensions in your Final Year Dissertation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment tools can exhibit various types of validity, each vital in distinct research contexts - try to establish which is important in your particular research domain.

Accurate assessment depends on consistent measurement, meaning enhancing reliability can potentially increase validity.\nReliability Does Not Guarantee Accuracy: While necessary, reliability alone doesn’t ensure the accuracy of an assessment. For example, consistently measuring head circumference as an indicator of intelligence might be reliable but lacks validity since head size doesn’t reflect intelligence."

    "text": "Determining Reliability Mathematically\nTo determine reliability, numerical data is essential. For instance, in observational research, the agreement percentage between two assistants categorizing data can indicate reliability. A 95% agreement suggests high reliability, while a 50% rate is concerning. In certain quantitative research, more complex statistical analyses are used, involving correlation coefficients to measure the degree of similarity in assessment results. You might use this if your mini-dissertation involved behavioural coding or observation techniques."

    "text": "Enhancing Reliability (and Indirectly Validity)\n\nDefining Clear Criteria: Especially in assessments requiring subjective judgment, defining specific criteria for categorizing or rating is crucial. Concrete, illustrative examples can clarify categories, such as different types of aggression in behavioral studies. This might take the form of a code-book.\nStandardization in Structured Instruments: Consistency in content, format, and evaluation criteria is key. However, adjustments may be needed for participants with disabilities to ensure validity.\nRater Training for Consistency: When subjective judgments are involved, training raters to apply criteria uniformly enhances both reliability and validity. Revisions to the strategy for greater rater consistency might also be necessary as part of the piloting programme.\n\nRemember, this is all aiming to deliver the most accurate, and high-resolution data possible. I think it is intuitive to see this in action - a natural drive for precision, but this applies to online tools also. Please pilot. Please verify your data are in a proper format when you export it, or prepare to analyse it. Mistakes are not a problem this year (within reason), but will be upsetting next year!"

If a single study is the combined efforts of multiple students, and collects data for a number of Mini-Dissertations, it only need ethical approval once, but you must list ALL students involved. All students should be familiar with the ethical considerations of their study and have been involved in the process of making the application.  \nEvery individual student must have applied for ethics, or have been named on an ethics application, in order to pass the module."

    "text": "ACCESSING THE SYSTEM\nThe ethics system can be accessed through the departmental student dashboard: https://psy770.gold.ac.uk/student There are two steps to log in.\n\n\n\nWhen you click on the link a pop-up box will appear, you need to enter the following:\nUsername: student\nPassword: goldpsy\nYou will then be asked to use your normal username and password to access your personal ethics portal:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the appropriate project type, choose the current year, and give the application a meaningful name (unlike Best Mini-Dissertation EVER!). Consider something along the lines of ‘The effect of personality and chronotype on Imposter Syndrome in higher education’. Informative and clear.\n\n\n\nYour ‘Supervisor’ will be your Lab Tutor.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have done this, your application will be available to edit, view, upload supporting documents, view comments, view messages from the committee or your supervisor, or delete (if necessary).\n\nClick edit to start completing the form. The first item you will see is ‘co-applicants’. It is normal that a single student may take the lead on drafting the ethics application, but all students who will obtain data from the task must be listed. Please make sure that this is complete. In order to pass the module, all students must be listed in a successful ethics application.\nI have added Ian Hannent (our Department Systems Engineer) as my co-applicant. Do this for all the students for whom the proposed study will provide data, and only those students. You can find a list of current students in the dropdown box.\nPlease contact your lab tutor if your name does not appear on the list!\n\n\nYou are then presented with 15 questions to which you must respond Yes, No or Not Applicable (N/A). Please read these carefully and respond correctly.\nBy responding Yes to any questions beyond question 11 will usually require you to complete a ’Box B’ application, meaning that extra information will be required to ensure full compliance and safety. YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE A CATEGORY B APPLICATION. If you feel that you need to answer YES to any question after 11… Reconsider.\n\nIt is common that you may conceal a little about the study in the information sheet in order to avoid contaminating results. This is misleading a participant, in that it is NOT fully informed consent. This can however be offset by giving a very clear debrief and telling the participant what you did and why in that debrief. I believe this is one of the more common queries. In second place is a query as to what constitutes distress or discomfort.\nIf the topic of your research raises a topic or concept that may in any way be upsetting or worrying to a participant, address this very clearly in the debrief. I do work on deception and psychopathy, and either of those topics could be upsetting to an individual who has been victim to deceit, or who hears about psychopaths for the first time. I would always give a very clear source of further information AND support that participants can follow up if they need. I believe this is just good practice.\n When the Online Data Collection box is selected, you will see the following questions.\nAs noted in the lab slides, you have to submit a link to a COMPLETE, published version of your task for review if you plan to collect data solely online.\nFor questions 1 – 9 you must give a short answer as to how these objectives will be achieved.\n\nSelect A if you consider your application without any ethical concerns - For the purposes of your Mini-Dissertation, you are required to submit a category A application. As noted above. If you feel you are entering Category B territory - think again.\n\nProvide short, but detailed responses to the questions below. These are not ‘marked’ but failure to give complete information will result in a request for resubmission.\nWhat you are trying to find out and the justification for asking the question. An ethical research project has a worthwhile and meaningful objective.  \n\nGive an overview of the various parts of your study, perhaps in order to help the reviewer, with details of the measures involved. If you are using a standardised questionnaire, say so WITH REFERENCE. If you have created questions yourself, say so.\n\nInsert a short summary of your power calculation and estimated sample size. Give specific details of how you propose to advertise the study and where and any pre-requisites around demographics or exclusion/inclusion criteria. Please be specific. If you wish to advertise your study on social media please specify the types of channels or audiences being targeted in case it may be problematic. For example, recruiting participants of a particular characteristic by entering an online community uninvited may be upsetting to its members. Consider any potentially damaging effects for would-be participants, even from just an invitation to participate in research.\n\nPlease reiterate here the process of informed consent, debriefing and any use of identifying information (such as email addresses or identifiers).\n\nInclude the dates as relevant and upload copies of the Information Sheet, Informed Consent questions, GDPR and debrief. This should be IDENTICAL to the information in your online task (if you use one), so copy it from there into separate word documents. This will be stored on file.\n\n\n\nYou can save the form at any time and come back to it. Once you have completed all the questions and uploaded the documents, you will be able to submit the form using the Submit button at the bottom of the form."

Accurate assessment depends on consistent measurement, meaning enhancing reliability can potentially increase validity.\nReliability Does Not Guarantee Accuracy: While necessary, reliability alone doesn’t ensure the accuracy of an assessment. For example, consistently measuring head circumference as an indicator of intelligence might be reliable but lacks validity since head size doesn’t reflect intelligence."

For instance, in observational research, the agreement percentage between two assistants categorizing data can indicate reliability. A 95% agreement suggests high reliability, while a 50% rate is concerning. In certain quantitative research, more complex statistical analyses are used, involving correlation coefficients to measure the degree of similarity in assessment results. You might use this if your mini-dissertation involved behavioural coding or observation techniques."

Concrete, illustrative examples can clarify categories, such as different types of aggression in behavioral studies. This might take the form of a code-book.\nStandardization in Structured Instruments: Consistency in content, format, and evaluation criteria is key. However, adjustments may be needed for participants with disabilities to ensure validity.\nRater Training for Consistency: When subjective judgments are involved, training raters to apply criteria uniformly enhances both reliability and validity. Revisions to the strategy for greater rater consistency might also be necessary as part of the piloting programme.\n\nRemember, this is all aiming to deliver the most accurate, and high-resolution data possible. I think it is intuitive to see this in action - a natural drive for precision, but this applies to online tools also. Please pilot. Please verify your data are in a proper format when you export it, or prepare to analyse it. Mistakes are not a problem this year (within reason), but will be upsetting next year!"

Open research ensures that the data and methodologies used are accessible to others, facilitating a deeper understanding of what was done and verification of research findings.\nBuilding Trust in Scientific Findings: Transparent practices in research foster trust among the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. When researchers openly share their methods and data, it demonstrates a commitment to honesty and integrity in their work.\nPromoting Collaboration and Innovation: Open research encourages collaborative efforts, as it allows researchers from different fields and geographies to access, utilize, and build upon existing knowledge. This cross-pollination of ideas can lead to innovative solutions and advancements.\nAccelerating Scientific Discovery: By making research findings and data openly available, the pace of scientific discovery can be quickened. Researchers can leverage existing work to explore new avenues of inquiry without duplicating efforts.\nAdvancing Educational Opportunities: Open research provides valuable resources for education and training (maybe you benefited from access to Open Resources while developing your Mini-Dissertation?), allowing students and early-career researchers to access a wealth of information and learn from real-world data and methodologies.\n\n\n\n\nFacilitating Research Transparency: Open materials, which include datasets, software, protocols, and other research tools, are central to ensuring transparency. They allow others to understand, evaluate, and replicate the research process.\nStandardizing Research Practices: Open materials can help in standardizing procedures across studies, leading to more consistent and reliable research outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nComprehensiveness: They should provide a complete picture of the research process you employed, including informed consent and information information, tools used, and detailed methodological information.\nAccessibility: Materials should be easily accessible to researchers from various fields, irrespective of their resources. Don’t share files that can’t be viewed by anyone, such as pay-for-software etc. It’s not such a huge deal for the Mini-Dissertation, but in reality, it’s counter to the point if you share, say, an SPSS file.\nUsability: Open materials should be user-friendly, with clear documentation and instructions to enable effective utilization by others. They are designed to facilitate, not complicate!\nInteroperability: Compatibility with different platforms and software is crucial to ensure that a wide range of researchers can use these materials. Similar to 2, but distinct.\nLongevity: Ensuring that open materials are preserved for long-term use and remain accessible as technologies evolve. Again, not a big deal with a coursework submission, as they will NOT be published by me, but if you publish your Final Year Dissertation, you would want it to be long-lived!\n\nBy adhering to these principles of Openness and Collaborativeness, the scientific community can significantly benefit from open research practices, leading to more robust, innovative, and transparent scientific inquiry. And less frustration/guess-work when you come to replicate or extend work!\n\n\n\n\nYour open materials are obviously going to be specific to your own research study. They obviously need to fully illustrate the wonderful things that you’ve created in the course of your mini-dissertation.\nFor the purposes of the mini-dissertation, you can take one of two approaches. You can either be extremely selfish and solely present the materials and tools that you used to generate the data for your individual 2x2 ANOVA, or you could view it as a mark-winning opportunity to demonstrate the wide-ranging gorgeousness of all the things that you and your group submitted.\nFor the purposes of the marking, the open materials is not a right or wrong exercise. Make the decision of what to include yourself. But do pay attention to what a Researcher such as myself would need to fully understand your task and to be able to replicate it. It’s fine if I can’t fully replicate something that belongs to somebody else, but I need to be able to replicate what you produced.\nAnd do pay attention to what goes in open materials and what goes in open data. It is common that people have trouble working out where a questionnaire and its associated data might go.\nI want to be able to test people with the right questionnaire measure and I would want to find the ‘questionnaire’ in Open Materials. But of course, the questionnaire results will appear in open data, where a codebook might be useful. But we’ll cover that next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn.b. Treatment of IVs, data, pre-processing steps or similar could be handled in Open Data. Just be clear!"

    "section": "Open Data requirements",
    "text": "Open Data requirements\nOpen Data is the concept of making research data accessible to everyone, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research - all critical features of an Open Science. In the field of psychology, sharing data is crucial for advancing scientific knowledge. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions for creating an Open Data submission for a psychology research project such as the Mini-Dissertation (and your Final Year Dissertations for that matter!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nIt is a compulsory that you submit your data. If you do not submit something, then your submission is not complete and the mark awarded will be impacted.\nBy taking the time to produce a clear Open Data submission, you will enhance the overall quality of your submission, and this will be reflected in your mark.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare your data: Before submitting your data, ensure that it is well-organized, accurate, and complete. You might be fixated on doing the analysis, but in many ways, the way you treat and pre-process your data (prepare it for the analysis) is even more critical to reliable results.\nThis includes:\na. Cleaning and validating the data: Remove any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. This may be down to participant error or a result of anything you might have done in this, your first data collection exercise (mistakes are to be EXPECTED! Don’t hide them!). Make sure the data is properly formatted (an example here might be consistent decimal places, or labelling in your variable headers.\nb. Anonymizing the data: To protect participants’ privacy, remove any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, addresses, or user generated codes. Replace these with unique identifiers, if necessary. This can be as simple as a number from 1 - n (where n is your total sample size).\nCreate a data dictionary or codebook: A data dictionary is a simple document that describes the variables in your dataset, their definitions, units of measurement, and any coding schemes used, such as values for any categorised data e.g. gender (1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = prefer not to say).\nThis will help others understand and use your data more effectively. Consider including the following information for each variable:\n\nVariable name as it exists in your dataset\nVariable description - what is the variable? Score on what measure of your Open Materials?\nData type (e.g., categorical, continuous, binary)\nUnits of measurement (if applicable, milliseconds, hours per day)\nConsider count information, or summary information (mean, range etc)\nCoding scheme (if applicable, 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree etc.)\n\nInformation on any pre-processing you performed:\nWhat were your decision rules on missing data or participant exclusion? Your data set can be the original data set which includes data you later do not analyse, or the data set that had undergone pre-processing and had had all the missing values removed… in either case, I want to know the process involved, so that I will be able to do it if I try to replicate your analysis!\nChoose a suitable format (or formats) for submission: In real research, you could host this on OSF.io or a similar data repository, but you are going to submit it as a supplementary file. Choose a format (or formats) that are usable. Ideally, I would like to be able to import your data directly, so it should be in a .csv, .xlsx, or .sav file, but Jamovi, R or equivalent is fine too.\nAny descriptive content (such as 3 or 4) could be in a pdf and submitted alongside the Mini-Dissertation (you can submit up to 5 files)\n\nBy following these guidelines, you will contribute to a more transparent and collaborative research environment in the field of psychology, ultimately promoting the advancement of scientific knowledge."

    "text": "Analysing your data starts here… with good set up!\nI know that you have used SPSS plenty already, but it is normally the case that you’ve only worked on downloaded pre-existing data sets, or followed step-by-step guides as a class. This time, these are YOUR data, of which you should be proud! Nobody has ever seen these data before.\nExamples of the 3 flavours of dataset can be found on the VLE.\nFor your Mini-Dissertations you are going through all the stages of a research project, from idea origination, through to the final presentation of the report. One of the parts that often (unnecessarily) causes anxiety is the analysis. Don’t let it! You’ll get lots of help in the labs!\nIt is important that you go about the process of data preparation and analysis methodically and with care. You’ve worked hard to generate these data, give them the attention they deserve. And at the end of the process… you get to see what happened in your experiment.\nThis worksheet will offer you tools to start off well. I don’t doubt that you will have an occasional mishap, but that is how we learn and improve. And I still google things sometimes!\nRemember, the mini-dissertation is carefully constrained to a 2x2 design, but by using this as a case-study, we can equip you with all the skills necessary for something more exotic next year.\nWhen you open SPSS, you’ll see the familiar Data Editor screen. Let me point a few things out.\n\n Open data document. This is where you can navigate to open your data set. Obvious, I know.\n This button saves your data set. Use this regularly. And save your data set in the cloud. You do not want to have to redo data preparation. And use version control. If you spend time on a data set and reach the end of a session, save it with the date and start the next session with a copy. I dearly hope you listen to this, and don’t learn the hard way.\n Recently used dialogues. Allows you to pick from a dropdown menu of operations you have performed previously. Most people don’t get to know this button exists and spend hours clicking through the menus. Using this button is the easiest way to do what you did last time, but make a slight modification (e.g. you forgot to select something).\n Most things that you do in the data editor window can be undone and redone. Anything that can’t be undone will give you a warning window. If you are going to try stuff out, use a copy of your dataset and keep a safe copy of the last one you were working on – see Save button above.\n Flip between Value labels. You’ll see how this can be helpful later on. Just pointing it out for now.\n Sometimes you want to look at your data (the numbers) and sometimes you want to look at what the data are (labels and types of variables). Data View lets you look at the numbers. Variable View lets you look at the labels and types of variables in your data. Let’s look at Variable View now.\nNow that you are reminded of those, let’s get things ready for when your data are ready."

    "text": "Data input\nIt may seem supremely dull, but properly formatting and labelling your data is important. Remember that you will be uploading a dataset as part of your submission under Open Data. It is important that an outsider can understand your dataset and use it to reproduce your analysis, should they wish.\n We use the Variable View in SPSS to add and define the variables used in our study. Each row represents one of your variables. Here, we can give them sensible names and specify the type of data we are entering for each one.\nSo start by thinking about Name. A variable name should be easy to understand and informative. You can’t use spaces or symbols, so you should think about using underscores or hyphens to-make-things_easier_to_understand.\nType specifies the type of data that is contained in that variable.\nWhen inputting your data, you will likely mostly use Numeric, which simply means it mostly numbers. It could be scores on a test, or categories which might be relevant for gender or group membership (1=Female, 2= Male, 3= Prefer not to say, etc)\n\nWidth refers to the maximum number of characters in a given variable. I don’t think I’ve ever changed this from 8.\nDecimals allows you to specify if a value shows decimal places or not. I’ve used 0 in some screengrabs below, so that decimal places are not shown, and 2 decimal places in others. I would suggest sticking with the default of 2, unless you are using very precise measurements.\nLabel is VERY handy. It doesn’t have the restrictions of Name, and so you can give a variable a really clear informative label. And it shows up in the output, meaning that the output is more easily understood. Do take the time to use this field, as once you step away from a dataset for even a couple of hours, it’s possible to forget what a variable is or represents.\n\nValue is particularly useful for categorical variables (or nominal, named variables as SPSS prefers). Assign every group a name and SPSS will attach that name to the output too. It’s easier to compare output with the labels ‘Females’ and ‘Males’ than ‘1’ and ‘2’.\n\nEnter the numeric value for your group, enter the label and click ‘add’ and your label will be stored.\nMeasure allows you to specify the measurement type for a variable, and sometimes this allows SPSS to deal with the data more accurately, so it is important.\n\nUse Scale if you are entering interval or ration data (i.e. where the difference between scores on the scale is meaningful and standardised; and intervals across the scale are equal) such as response times or accuracy rates.\nOrdinal if you have a categorical variable where the order of the categories matter, such as Lickert Scales,\nand Nominal if you have a categorical variable where the order of categories does not matter.\nYou can also further classify your data according to Role , but this is not crucial.\n\nInput. The variable will be used as an input (e.g., predictor, independent variable).\nTarget. The variable will be used as an output or target (e.g., dependent variable).\nBoth. The variable will be used as both input and output. This is the case with some aspects of the 2x2 design, but don’t get caught up with this.\nNone. The variable has no role assignment.\nPartition. The variable will be used to partition the data into separate samples for training, testing, and validation. Or if you will exclude some participants based on the value.\nSplit. Is used for advanced functions I won’t go into here."

    "text": "Some useful calculations in SPSS\nSometimes your data is not yet entirely ready for analysis and you need to calculate a value to make your data make sense or to permit further analysis. I shall present two useful calculations here.\nIt might be that you need to sum all the questions in a questionnaire to get a grand total. Or you need to find the average score on a group of questions or trials in an experiment.\nI shall use that last example, calculating a mean score on a set of trials, to illustrate this functionality, but you can do lots of useful things the same way, simply by inserting variables in the SPSS dataset into a calculation.\nAnother thing that many of you may need to do is to perform a median split , where you take a continuous variable such as a score on a personality measure and ‘cut it in half’ so that 50% of your sample is considered low, and 50% is considered high.\nSo here’s an experiment that needs me to do both of these things.\nIt’s a 2x2 Mixed design experiment I ran recently, with 16 individuals in my dataset.\nI have allocated each participant a unique ID number, and I have age and gender as demographic characteristics.\nI have a variable to confirm their having given Informed Consent, and at this point I have already removed any identifying information, and so this is anonymous.\nParticipants completed a Psychopathy Questionnaire (The Triarchic Psychopathy Measure – TriPM) giving me a possible score of between 0 and 174 for each participant. I shall return to this measure when talking about SPSS Scoring Syntax and Syntax more generally.\nThey then took part in a decision-making task, where they responded to choices in 2 different scenarios. In one scenario they would be rewarded as part of a team, in another they would be rewarded individually. They each responded to two trials in each of the two conditions (within-subject IV with 2 levels - manipulation of reward type: team reward or individual reward).\nReaction Time was recorded for each trial to indicate how quickly the participant made the decision.\nBelow is a snapshot of the Variable View and Data View. You’ll see that I need to complete the Median Split variable, and the two mean scores variables at the right hand side.\nVariable View.\n\nData View with numeric values (e.g. gender 1,2,3)\n\nData View with value labels (using the value labels button above) (see gender)"

    "section": "Performing a Median Split in SPSS",
    "text": "Performing a Median Split in SPSS\nPerforming a median split allows you to categorise participants into discreet groups based on a continuous variable. You turn a continuous variable into a dichotomous variable (low & high, for example). The median is used because it is the number at which point 50% of values lie above, and 50% lie below. This means that usually, you get a nice equal sample size in both groups.\nThe median split procedure is sometimes better than using a cut off score or threshold, as a median split uses the data that you have in hand, and doesn’t assume anything about the sample of scores that you have.\nI want to categorise my 16 participants into ‘LowPsychopathy’ and ‘HighPsychopathy’ groups of equal size (hopefully) using a median split procedure (essentially turning this into a quasi-experimental between-group IV with 2 levels).\nI could just work out the median with descriptive statistics, and then by hand label each person as lower than the median or higher than the median. With 16 participants, it might be quicker to do it that way, but with more it would be very dull indeed and I’d probably still get mixed up and make a mistake. So, I want to find a way to do it automatically and accurately.\nHere is the step-by-step procedure.\nGo to the Transform menu and select Visual Binning\n\nSimply put, this allows you to put participants into ‘bins’ based on a set of rules you make.\nSelect the variable you are going to use to divide people up. In this case, I choose the total score for my TriPM Psychopathy measure (TotalScoreTriPm), move it into the Variables to Bin field and click continue.\n\nI’m then presented with this view of the distribution of the data.\n\nSo we want to find the median, or the point at which we cut the data in half. We click the Make Cutpoints button.\nIn the section marked Equal percentiles based on scannedcases we input 1 in the number of cutpoints box and it automagically fills 50% in the width box. Click Apply\n\nThink about that. We asked SPSS to cut our variable into equal groups based on observed data with a single chop! It could only ever be at the Median! It’s a funny set of commands, but makes sense, right?\nIf we asked for 2 cutpoints, it would give Low, Medium and High groups cut at 33.33% and 66.66%. Two cuts with equal numbers on each side = 3 groups – a tertile split or trichotomized variable. But I digress.\nNow just label your new variable in the Binned Variable box and label the values.\nYou’ll notice that for the data I used, the value is up to and including 54 as low and anything over 54 is considered high. Bearing in mind the scale goes up to 174, and cutoff are usually much higher than 54, the median split is better for my data than that cutoff. There wouldn’t be ANYBODY in the high group.\n\nWhen you click on OK, it pops a new variable at the end of the data set with the information you need (highlighted in blue below). From here, I would move that variable to it’s rightful place in my dataset, or copy and paste the values into the relevant column if I had already set it up. Alternatively, I could have given it exactly the same name in the Binned Variable label setting and it would have replaced the empty cells. But I wanted you to see that new variables usually pop to the far end of the data set."

In this instance, I want to calculate the mean response time for decisions in the two individual reward trials, so that for each participant I have a mean response time across all trials of that type.\n\nFrom the Transform menu, you want to select Compute Variable and the following window will open up.\nFirstly, in Target Variable type in the name of the variable you want to calculate. I’ve chosen ‘Mean_IndividualReward’.\nThen double click All in the Function group: dropdown to see all the calculations you could use. Scroll down to Mean in the Functions and Special Variables dropdown. Have a look at some of the other options. You can see Sum and Sqrt for example, which is a calculated sum total and square root, respectively.\n\nUsing the little blue arrow pointing upwards, put Mean into the Numeric Expression box. This is where you put in a simple formula to tell SPSS how to calculate the new variable. You can use this just like a calculator, and insert a variable then + then another variable using the calculator keyboard. It’s super easy.\n\nIt should look like the window above, and quite simply, you replace the ‘?’ with the variables you want to use from the left hand column. So, you can double click on the variables in the left hand column to send them up to the Numeric Expression box and separate them with commas.\n\n\nYou see I have calculated the mean of 2 trials, but you can do this for any number of variables. This is a useful tool and works like excel formulae. It will then just pop a new column at the end of your dataset with the relevant output of the calculation.\n\nDo remember that if you want to perform other calculations, you can find excellent help on the internet. Don’t be afraid of trying things out and exploring the features of SPSS. It is confusing at times, but once you understand what it is trying to do, you’ll find that it is very clever and can save you time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nNOW SAVE YOUR DATA!

    "text": "Open Data is the concept of making research data accessible to everyone, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research - all critical features of an Open Science. In the field of psychology, sharing data is crucial for advancing scientific knowledge. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions for creating an Open Data submission for a psychology research project such as the Mini-Dissertation (and your Final Year Dissertations for that matter!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is a compulsory that you submit your data. If you do not submit something, then your submission is not complete and the mark awarded will be impacted.\nBy taking the time to produce a clear Open Data submission, you will enhance the overall quality of your submission, and this will be reflected in your mark.\n\n\n\nPrepare your data: Before submitting your data, ensure that it is well-organized, accurate, and complete. You might be fixated on doing the analysis, but in many ways, the way you treat and pre-process your data (prepare it for the analysis) is even more critical to reliable results.\nThis includes:\na. Cleaning and validating the data: Remove any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. This may be down to participant error or a result of anything you might have done in this, your first data collection exercise (mistakes are to be EXPECTED! Don’t hide them!). Make sure the data is properly formatted (an example here might be consistent decimal places, or labelling in your variable headers.\nb. Anonymizing the data: To protect participants’ privacy, remove any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, addresses, or user generated codes. Replace these with unique identifiers, if necessary. This can be as simple as a number from 1 - n (where n is your total sample size).\nCreate a data dictionary or codebook: A data dictionary is a simple document that describes the variables in your dataset, their definitions, units of measurement, and any coding schemes used, such as values for any categorised data e.g. gender (1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = prefer not to say).\nThis will help others understand and use your data more effectively. Consider including the following information for each variable:\n\nVariable name as it exists in your dataset\nVariable description - what is the variable? Score on what measure of your Open Materials?\nData type (e.g., categorical, continuous, binary)\nUnits of measurement (if applicable, milliseconds, hours per day)\nConsider count information, or summary information (mean, range etc)\nCoding scheme (if applicable, 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree etc.)\n\nInformation on any pre-processing you performed:\nWhat were your decision rules on missing data or participant exclusion? Your data set can be the original data set which includes data you later do not analyse, or the data set that had undergone pre-processing and had had all the missing values removed… in either case, I want to know the process involved, so that I will be able to do it if I try to replicate your analysis!\nChoose a suitable format (or formats) for submission: In real research, you could host this on OSF.io or a similar data repository, but you are going to submit it as a supplementary file. Choose a format (or formats) that are usable. Ideally, I would like to be able to import your data directly, so it should be in a .csv, .xlsx, or .sav file, but Jamovi, R or equivalent is fine too.\nAny descriptive content (such as 3 or 4) could be in a pdf and submitted alongside the Mini-Dissertation (you can submit up to 5 files)\n\nBy following these guidelines, you will contribute to a more transparent and collaborative research environment in the field of psychology, ultimately promoting the advancement of scientific knowledge.\n\n\n\nGoals and outcomes of this week:\n\nA quick review of the SPSS Data editor window and some useful menu options\nInputting data into SPSS for your specific ANOVA design\n\n2x2 Independent (between-groups) ANOVA\n2x2 Repeated measures ANOVA\n2x2 Mixed ANOVA\n\nSome useful calculations in SPSS\n\nPerforming a Median Split in SPSS\nCalculating a mean score variable\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that you have used SPSS plenty already, but it is normally the case that you’ve only worked on downloaded pre-existing data sets, or followed step-by-step guides as a class. This time, these are YOUR data, of which you should be proud! Nobody has ever seen these data before.\nExamples of the 3 flavours of dataset can be found on the VLE.\nFor your Mini-Dissertations you are going through all the stages of a research project, from idea origination, through to the final presentation of the report. One of the parts that often (unnecessarily) causes anxiety is the analysis. Don’t let it! You’ll get lots of help in the labs!\nIt is important that you go about the process of data preparation and analysis methodically and with care. You’ve worked hard to generate these data, give them the attention they deserve. And at the end of the process… you get to see what happened in your experiment.\nThis worksheet will offer you tools to start off well. I don’t doubt that you will have an occasional mishap, but that is how we learn and improve. And I still google things sometimes!\nRemember, the mini-dissertation is carefully constrained to a 2x2 design, but by using this as a case-study, we can equip you with all the skills necessary for something more exotic next year.\nWhen you open SPSS, you’ll see the familiar Data Editor screen. Let me point a few things out.\n\n Open data document. This is where you can navigate to open your data set. Obvious, I know.\n This button saves your data set. Use this regularly. And save your data set in the cloud. You do not want to have to redo data preparation. And use version control. If you spend time on a data set and reach the end of a session, save it with the date and start the next session with a copy. I dearly hope you listen to this, and don’t learn the hard way.\n Recently used dialogues. Allows you to pick from a dropdown menu of operations you have performed previously. Most people don’t get to know this button exists and spend hours clicking through the menus. Using this button is the easiest way to do what you did last time, but make a slight modification (e.g. you forgot to select something).\n Most things that you do in the data editor window can be undone and redone. Anything that can’t be undone will give you a warning window. If you are going to try stuff out, use a copy of your dataset and keep a safe copy of the last one you were working on – see Save button above.\n Flip between Value labels. You’ll see how this can be helpful later on. Just pointing it out for now.\n Sometimes you want to look at your data (the numbers) and sometimes you want to look at what the data are (labels and types of variables). Data View lets you look at the numbers. Variable View lets you look at the labels and types of variables in your data. Let’s look at Variable View now.\nNow that you are reminded of those, let’s get things ready for when your data are ready.\n\n\n\nIt may seem supremely dull, but properly formatting and labelling your data is important. Remember that you will be uploading a dataset as part of your submission under Open Data. It is important that an outsider can understand your dataset and use it to reproduce your analysis, should they wish.\n We use the Variable View in SPSS to add and define the variables used in our study.

I don’t think I’ve ever changed this from 8.\nDecimals allows you to specify if a value shows decimal places or not. I’ve used 0 in some screengrabs below, so that decimal places are not shown, and 2 decimal places in others. I would suggest sticking with the default of 2, unless you are using very precise measurements.\nLabel is VERY handy. It doesn’t have the restrictions of Name, and so you can give a variable a really clear informative label. And it shows up in the output, meaning that the output is more easily understood.

Simply put, syntax is the code that runs the SPSS analysis behind the scenes.\nThis is something you could ask about in the labs if you are interested. It’s not something we usually teach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an independent ANOVA, each participant belongs in only one condition or cell in your 2x2 design grid, meaning that they are allocated to only one condition for each of your IVs out of the possible 4.\n\nSo in the example of my experiment examining the effect of Puzzle Difficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and Background Music (IV2 with 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in Seconds), I would randomly allocate people to solve one puzzle ONLY after informed consent. So there are four conditions and a participant in my study will only do one of them.\nAn easy puzzle with slow background music, an easy puzzle with fast background music, a difficult puzzle with slow background music or a difficult puzzle with fast background music.\nYou need to label the condition each participant was in for each of your IVs separately so that SPSS knows what puzzle condition they got and what music condition they got.\nAs always, each row corresponds to a single participant.\nIn this example, I’ve called Puzzle Difficulty IV1Difficulty so that you can replace this in your mind with your first IV. I’ve used the Label and Values to identify Easy puzzle group with 1 and the difficult puzzle group with 2. IV2MusicSpeed uses 1 to signify the Slow music condition and 2 to signify the Fast music condition\nThe first panel shows this in data view with numeric values , the right panel with value labels.

They would have been given all four conditions from a possible four.\n\nSo, in the example of my experiment examining the effect of Puzzle Difficulty (IV1 with 2 levels - Easy, Hard) and Background Music (IV2 with 2 levels - Slow, Fast) on Solving Time (DV in Seconds), I would randomly sequence the puzzles and music, but a participant in my study would solve four puzzles making up all the possible combinations of difficulty and music. In short, both levels of both of my IVs.\nEvery participant would have solved an easy puzzle with slow background music, an easy puzzle with fast background music, a difficult puzzle with slow background music and a difficult puzzle with fast background music. Busy day!\nIn the previous example, we had one DV measure and needed to tell SPSS which condition the participant was in. In this example, we have 4 measures of the DV (how long it took to solve each puzzle) so we need to let SPSS see which response time corresponds to each condition.\nAs always, each row corresponds to a single participant.\nIn a repeated measures ANOVA setup, we don’t need to use numbered groups or labels, instead we rely on using Name in Variable View to identify each of the 4 conditions the participant experienced. So this is one of the simplest data sets.\nDownload the 2x2 Repeated Measures ANOVA dataset here\nData view numeric values\n\nVariable View\n\n\n\n\nAs you know, a repeated-measures ANOVA contains only within-participant variables (where participants take part in all conditions).\nAn independent ANOVA uses only between-group variables (where participants only take part in one condition),\n\nA mixed ANOVA contains BOTH variable types. In this case, one of each. You will necessarily have one within-participant IV and one between-group IV.\n\nIn this last toy example using the puzzle music experiment, I decided that participants were allocated to either the Easy or the Difficult Puzzle condition (puzzle difficulty is the between-group IV with 2 levels)\nEach participant then did two puzzles with both of the levels of the Background Music condition, one puzzle with Slow background music, and one puzzle with Fast background music (music is the within-participant IV with 2 levels).\nAs always, each row corresponds to a single participant.\nIn this case, each participant solved 2 puzzles and so needs two measures, but we need to identify the condition of the between-group IV that they were in Easy Puzzles or Difficult Puzzles.\nDownload the 2x2 Mixed ANOVA dataset here\nData view numeric values\n\nData view with variable labels\n\nVariable view\n\n\n\n\nSometimes your data is not yet entirely ready for analysis and you need to calculate a value to make your data make sense or to permit further analysis. I shall present two useful calculations here.\nIt might be that you need to sum all the questions in a questionnaire to get a grand total. Or you need to find the average score on a group of questions or trials in an experiment.\nI shall use that last example, calculating a mean score on a set of trials, to illustrate this functionality, but you can do lots of useful things the same way, simply by inserting variables in the SPSS dataset into a calculation.\nAnother thing that many of you may need to do is to perform a median split , where you take a continuous variable such as a score on a personality measure and ‘cut it in half’ so that 50% of your sample is considered low, and 50% is considered high.\nSo here’s an experiment that needs me to do both of these things.\nIt’s a 2x2 Mixed design experiment I ran recently, with 16 individuals in my dataset.\nI have allocated each participant a unique ID number, and I have age and gender as demographic characteristics.\nI have a variable to confirm their having given Informed Consent, and at this point I have already removed any identifying information, and so this is anonymous.\nParticipants completed a Psychopathy Questionnaire (The Triarchic Psychopathy Measure – TriPM) giving me a possible score of between 0 and 174 for each participant. I shall return to this measure when talking about SPSS Scoring Syntax and Syntax more generally.\nThey then took part in a decision-making task, where they responded to choices in 2 different scenarios. In one scenario they would be rewarded as part of a team, in another they would be rewarded individually. They each responded to two trials in each of the two conditions (within-subject IV with 2 levels - manipulation of reward type: team reward or individual reward).\nReaction Time was recorded for each trial to indicate how quickly the participant made the decision.\nBelow is a snapshot of the Variable View and Data View. You’ll see that I need to complete the Median Split variable, and the two mean scores variables at the right hand side.\nVariable View.\n\nData View with numeric values (e.g. gender 1,2,3)\n\nData View with value labels (using the value labels button above) (see gender)\n\n\n\n\nPerforming a median split allows you to categorise participants into discreet groups based on a continuous variable. You turn a continuous variable into a dichotomous variable (low & high, for example). The median is used because it is the number at which point 50% of values lie above, and 50% lie below. This means that usually, you get a nice equal sample size in both groups.\nThe median split procedure is sometimes better than using a cut off score or threshold, as a median split uses the data that you have in hand, and doesn’t assume anything about the sample of scores that you have.\nI want to categorise my 16 participants into ‘LowPsychopathy’ and ‘HighPsychopathy’ groups of equal size (hopefully) using a median split procedure (essentially turning this into a quasi-experimental between-group IV with 2 levels).\nI could just work out the median with descriptive statistics, and then by hand label each person as lower than the median or higher than the median. With 16 participants, it might be quicker to do it that way, but with more it would be very dull indeed and I’d probably still get mixed up and make a mistake. So, I want to find a way to do it automatically and accurately.\nHere is the step-by-step procedure.\nGo to the Transform menu and select Visual Binning\n\nSimply put, this allows you to put participants into ‘bins’ based on a set of rules you make.\nSelect the variable you are going to use to divide people up. In this case, I choose the total score for my TriPM Psychopathy measure (TotalScoreTriPm), move it into the Variables to Bin field and click continue.\n\nI’m then presented with this view of the distribution of the data.\n\nSo we want to find the median, or the point at which we cut the data in half. We click the Make Cutpoints button.\nIn the section marked Equal percentiles based on scannedcases we input 1 in the number of cutpoints box and it automagically fills 50% in the width box. Click Apply\n\nThink about that. We asked SPSS to cut our variable into equal groups based on observed data with a single chop! It could only ever be at the Median! It’s a funny set of commands, but makes sense, right?\nIf we asked for 2 cutpoints, it would give Low, Medium and High groups cut at 33.33% and 66.66%. Two cuts with equal numbers on each side = 3 groups – a tertile split or trichotomized variable. But I digress.\nNow just label your new variable in the Binned Variable box and label the values.\nYou’ll notice that for the data I used, the value is up to and including 54 as low and anything over 54 is considered high. Bearing in mind the scale goes up to 174, and cutoff are usually much higher than 54, the median split is better for my data than that cutoff. There wouldn’t be ANYBODY in the high group.\n\nWhen you click on OK, it pops a new variable at the end of the data set with the information you need (highlighted in blue below). From here, I would move that variable to it’s rightful place in my dataset, or copy and paste the values into the relevant column if I had already set it up. Alternatively, I could have given it exactly the same name in the Binned Variable label setting and it would have replaced the empty cells. But I wanted you to see that new variables usually pop to the far end of the data set.\n\n\n\n\nNow to calculate the mean score across a series of variables. In this instance, I want to calculate the mean response time for decisions in the two individual reward trials, so that for each participant I have a mean response time across all trials of that type.\n\nFrom the Transform menu, you want to select Compute Variable and the following window will open up.\nFirstly, in Target Variable type in the name of the variable you want to calculate. I’ve chosen ‘Mean_IndividualReward’.\nThen double click All in the Function group: dropdown to see all the calculations you could use. Scroll down to Mean in the Functions and Special Variables dropdown. Have a look at some of the other options. You can see Sum and Sqrt for example, which is a calculated sum total and square root, respectively.\n\nUsing the little blue arrow pointing upwards, put Mean into the Numeric Expression box. This is where you put in a simple formula to tell SPSS how to calculate the new variable. You can use this just like a calculator, and insert a variable then + then another variable using the calculator keyboard. It’s super easy.\n\nIt should look like the window above, and quite simply, you replace the ‘?’ with the variables you want to use from the left hand column. So, you can double click on the variables in the left hand column to send them up to the Numeric Expression box and separate them with commas.\n\n\nYou see I have calculated the mean of 2 trials, but you can do this for any number of variables. This is a useful tool and works like excel formulae. It will then just pop a new column at the end of your dataset with the relevant output of the calculation.\n\nDo remember that if you want to perform other calculations, you can find excellent help on the internet. Don’t be afraid of trying things out and exploring the features of SPSS. It is confusing at times, but once you understand what it is trying to do, you’ll find that it is very clever and can save you time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNOW SAVE YOUR DATA! AND STORE IT IN THE CLOUD!\nYou do NOT want to have to redo things because your computer crashes!\n\n\nWell done and stay awesome!!"

    "text": "Open Data is the concept of making research data accessible to everyone, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research - all critical features of an Open Science. In the field of psychology, sharing data is crucial for advancing scientific knowledge. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions for creating an Open Data submission for a psychology research project such as the Mini-Dissertation (and your Final Year Dissertations for that matter!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is a compulsory that you submit your data. If you do not submit something, then your submission is not complete and the mark awarded will be impacted.\nBy taking the time to produce a clear Open Data submission, you will enhance the overall quality of your submission, and this will be reflected in your mark.\n\n\n\nPrepare your data: Before submitting your data, ensure that it is well-organized, accurate, and complete. You might be fixated on doing the analysis, but in many ways, the way you treat and pre-process your data (prepare it for the analysis) is even more critical to reliable results.\nThis includes:\na. Cleaning and validating the data: Remove any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. This may be down to participant error or a result of anything you might have done in this, your first data collection exercise (mistakes are to be EXPECTED! Don’t hide them!). Make sure the data is properly formatted (an example here might be consistent decimal places, or labelling in your variable headers.\nb. Anonymizing the data: To protect participants’ privacy, remove any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, addresses, or user generated codes. Replace these with unique identifiers, if necessary. This can be as simple as a number from 1 - n (where n is your total sample size).\nCreate a data dictionary or codebook: A data dictionary is a simple document that describes the variables in your dataset, their definitions, units of measurement, and any coding schemes used, such as values for any categorised data e.g. gender (1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = prefer not to say).\nThis will help others understand and use your data more effectively. Consider including the following information for each variable:\n\nVariable name as it exists in your dataset\nVariable description - what is the variable? Score on what measure of your Open Materials?\nData type (e.g., categorical, continuous, binary)\nUnits of measurement (if applicable, milliseconds, hours per day)\nConsider count information, or summary information (mean, range etc)\nCoding scheme (if applicable, 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree etc.)\n\nInformation on any pre-processing you performed:\nWhat were your decision rules on missing data or participant exclusion? Your data set can be the original data set which includes data you later do not analyse, or the data set that had undergone pre-processing and had had all the missing values removed… in either case, I want to know the process involved, so that I will be able to do it if I try to replicate your analysis!\nChoose a suitable format (or formats) for submission: In real research, you could host this on OSF.io or a similar data repository, but you are going to submit it as a supplementary file. Choose a format (or formats) that are usable. Ideally, I would like to be able to import your data directly, so it should be in a .csv, .xlsx, or .sav file, but Jamovi, R or equivalent is fine too.\nAny descriptive content (such as 3 or 4) could be in a pdf and submitted alongside the Mini-Dissertation (you can submit up to 5 files)\n\nBy following these guidelines, you will contribute to a more transparent and collaborative research environment in the field of psychology, ultimately promoting the advancement of scientific knowledge."

    "text": "I know that you have used SPSS plenty already, but it is normally the case that you’ve only worked on downloaded pre-existing data sets, or followed step-by-step guides as a class. This time, these are YOUR data, of which you should be proud! Nobody has ever seen these data before.\nExamples of the 3 flavours of dataset can be found on the VLE.\nFor your Mini-Dissertations you are going through all the stages of a research project, from idea origination, through to the final presentation of the report. One of the parts that often (unnecessarily) causes anxiety is the analysis. Don’t let it! You’ll get lots of help in the labs!\nIt is important that you go about the process of data preparation and analysis methodically and with care. You’ve worked hard to generate these data, give them the attention they deserve. And at the end of the process… you get to see what happened in your experiment.\nThis worksheet will offer you tools to start off well. I don’t doubt that you will have an occasional mishap, but that is how we learn and improve. And I still google things sometimes!\nRemember, the mini-dissertation is carefully constrained to a 2x2 design, but by using this as a case-study, we can equip you with all the skills necessary for something more exotic next year.\nWhen you open SPSS, you’ll see the familiar Data Editor screen. Let me point a few things out.\n\n Open data document. This is where you can navigate to open your data set. Obvious, I know.\n This button saves your data set. Use this regularly. And save your data set in the cloud. You do not want to have to redo data preparation. And use version control. If you spend time on a data set and reach the end of a session, save it with the date and start the next session with a copy. I dearly hope you listen to this, and don’t learn the hard way.\n Recently used dialogues. Allows you to pick from a dropdown menu of operations you have performed previously. Most people don’t get to know this button exists and spend hours clicking through the menus. Using this button is the easiest way to do what you did last time, but make a slight modification (e.g. you forgot to select something).\n Most things that you do in the data editor window can be undone and redone. Anything that can’t be undone will give you a warning window. If you are going to try stuff out, use a copy of your dataset and keep a safe copy of the last one you were working on – see Save button above.\n Flip between Value labels. You’ll see how this can be helpful later on. Just pointing it out for now.\n Sometimes you want to look at your data (the numbers) and sometimes you want to look at what the data are (labels and types of variables). Data View lets you look at the numbers. Variable View lets you look at the labels and types of variables in your data. Let’s look at Variable View now.\nNow that you are reminded of those, let’s get things ready for when your data are ready."

    "text": "It may seem supremely dull, but properly formatting and labelling your data is important. Remember that you will be uploading a dataset as part of your submission under Open Data. It is important that an outsider can understand your dataset and use it to reproduce your analysis, should they wish.\n We use the Variable View in SPSS to add and define the variables used in our study. Each row represents one of your variables. Here, we can give them sensible names and specify the type of data we are entering for each one.\nSo start by thinking about Name. A variable name should be easy to understand and informative. You can’t use spaces or symbols, so you should think about using underscores or hyphens to-make-things_easier_to_understand.\nType specifies the type of data that is contained in that variable.\nWhen inputting your data, you will likely mostly use Numeric, which simply means it mostly numbers. It could be scores on a test, or categories which might be relevant for gender or group membership (1=Female, 2= Male, 3= Prefer not to say, etc)\n\nWidth refers to the maximum number of characters in a given variable. I don’t think I’ve ever changed this from 8.\nDecimals allows you to specify if a value shows decimal places or not. I’ve used 0 in some screengrabs below, so that decimal places are not shown, and 2 decimal places in others. I would suggest sticking with the default of 2, unless you are using very precise measurements.\nLabel is VERY handy. It doesn’t have the restrictions of Name, and so you can give a variable a really clear informative label. And it shows up in the output, meaning that the output is more easily understood. Do take the time to use this field, as once you step away from a dataset for even a couple of hours, it’s possible to forget what a variable is or represents.\n\nValue is particularly useful for categorical variables (or nominal, named variables as SPSS prefers). Assign every group a name and SPSS will attach that name to the output too. It’s easier to compare output with the labels ‘Females’ and ‘Males’ than ‘1’ and ‘2’.\n\nEnter the numeric value for your group, enter the label and click ‘add’ and your label will be stored.\nMeasure allows you to specify the measurement type for a variable, and sometimes this allows SPSS to deal with the data more accurately, so it is important.\n\nUse Scale if you are entering interval or ration data (i.e. where the difference between scores on the scale is meaningful and standardised; and intervals across the scale are equal) such as response times or accuracy rates.\nOrdinal if you have a categorical variable where the order of the categories matter, such as Lickert Scales,\nand Nominal if you have a categorical variable where the order of categories does not matter.\nYou can also further classify your data according to Role , but this is not crucial.\n\nInput. The variable will be used as an input (e.g., predictor, independent variable).\nTarget. The variable will be used as an output or target (e.g., dependent variable).\nBoth. The variable will be used as both input and output. This is the case with some aspects of the 2x2 design, but don’t get caught up with this.\nNone. The variable has no role assignment.\nPartition. The variable will be used to partition the data into separate samples for training, testing, and validation. Or if you will exclude some participants based on the value.\nSplit. Is used for advanced functions I won’t go into here."

    "text": "Performing a median split allows you to categorise participants into discreet groups based on a continuous variable. You turn a continuous variable into a dichotomous variable (low & high, for example). The median is used because it is the number at which point 50% of values lie above, and 50% lie below. This means that usually, you get a nice equal sample size in both groups.\nThe median split procedure is sometimes better than using a cut off score or threshold, as a median split uses the data that you have in hand, and doesn’t assume anything about the sample of scores that you have.\nI want to categorise my 16 participants into ‘LowPsychopathy’ and ‘HighPsychopathy’ groups of equal size (hopefully) using a median split procedure (essentially turning this into a quasi-experimental between-group IV with 2 levels).\nI could just work out the median with descriptive statistics, and then by hand label each person as lower than the median or higher than the median. With 16 participants, it might be quicker to do it that way, but with more it would be very dull indeed and I’d probably still get mixed up and make a mistake. So, I want to find a way to do it automatically and accurately.\nHere is the step-by-step procedure.\nGo to the Transform menu and select Visual Binning\n\nSimply put, this allows you to put participants into ‘bins’ based on a set of rules you make.\nSelect the variable you are going to use to divide people up. In this case, I choose the total score for my TriPM Psychopathy measure (TotalScoreTriPm), move it into the Variables to Bin field and click continue.\n\nI’m then presented with this view of the distribution of the data.\n\nSo we want to find the median, or the point at which we cut the data in half. We click the Make Cutpoints button.\nIn the section marked Equal percentiles based on scannedcases we input 1 in the number of cutpoints box and it automagically fills 50% in the width box. Click Apply\n\nThink about that. We asked SPSS to cut our variable into equal groups based on observed data with a single chop! It could only ever be at the Median! It’s a funny set of commands, but makes sense, right?\nIf we asked for 2 cutpoints, it would give Low, Medium and High groups cut at 33.33% and 66.66%. Two cuts with equal numbers on each side = 3 groups – a tertile split or trichotomized variable. But I digress.\nNow just label your new variable in the Binned Variable box and label the values.\nYou’ll notice that for the data I used, the value is up to and including 54 as low and anything over 54 is considered high. Bearing in mind the scale goes up to 174, and cutoff are usually much higher than 54, the median split is better for my data than that cutoff. There wouldn’t be ANYBODY in the high group.\n\nWhen you click on OK, it pops a new variable at the end of the data set with the information you need (highlighted in blue below). From here, I would move that variable to it’s rightful place in my dataset, or copy and paste the values into the relevant column if I had already set it up. Alternatively, I could have given it exactly the same name in the Binned Variable label setting and it would have replaced the empty cells. But I wanted you to see that new variables usually pop to the far end of the data set."

    "text": "Now to calculate the mean score across a series of variables. In this instance, I want to calculate the mean response time for decisions in the two individual reward trials, so that for each participant I have a mean response time across all trials of that type.\n\nFrom the Transform menu, you want to select Compute Variable and the following window will open up.\nFirstly, in Target Variable type in the name of the variable you want to calculate. I’ve chosen ‘Mean_IndividualReward’.\nThen double click All in the Function group: dropdown to see all the calculations you could use. Scroll down to Mean in the Functions and Special Variables dropdown. Have a look at some of the other options. You can see Sum and Sqrt for example, which is a calculated sum total and square root, respectively.\n\nUsing the little blue arrow pointing upwards, put Mean into the Numeric Expression box. This is where you put in a simple formula to tell SPSS how to calculate the new variable. You can use this just like a calculator, and insert a variable then + then another variable using the calculator keyboard. It’s super easy.\n\nIt should look like the window above, and quite simply, you replace the ‘?’ with the variables you want to use from the left hand column. So, you can double click on the variables in the left hand column to send them up to the Numeric Expression box and separate them with commas.\n\n\nYou see I have calculated the mean of 2 trials, but you can do this for any number of variables. This is a useful tool and works like excel formulae. It will then just pop a new column at the end of your dataset with the relevant output of the calculation.\n\nDo remember that if you want to perform other calculations, you can find excellent help on the internet. Don’t be afraid of trying things out and exploring the features of SPSS. It is confusing at times, but once you understand what it is trying to do, you’ll find that it is very clever and can save you time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNOW SAVE YOUR DATA! AND STORE IT IN THE CLOUD!\nYou do NOT want to have to redo things because your computer crashes!\n\n\nWell done and stay awesome!!"
