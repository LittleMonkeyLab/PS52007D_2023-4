Or you might want to work with people from your PT group who share a similar interest.\nWork out how you wish to work. This is the last large-scale piece of group work you’ll do prior to getting a reference.\nStart thinking about how you can search for literature on the topic you have chosen.\nWhat methods are used? What is feasible? What would you like to learn about?"

    "text": "Quizzes\nThere will be 5 quizzes given about once every other week immediately at the beginning of class. You will not be told in advance when there is a quiz, and make up quizzes will not be available if you miss it (except for excused absences). Please show up on time to class each week to ensure that you do not miss a quiz.\nQuizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz. Quizzes are short (5-10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."

While students may work with their peers on these assignments, each student must submit their own work.

    "text": "How to prepare for each week in Research Methods\nMany hundreds of years ago, I was a Boy Scout, before that, I was a Brownie too, but that’s a story for another day. ‘Be Prepared’ is a valuable piece of advice. And that’s what I’m trying to help with here. You aren’t going to get the most out of the timetabled sessions, or your extensive independent study, if you don’t have a fair idea of what you need to do, by when, and what each activity entails.\nYour teaching team goes to a great deal of effort to answer any and all questions you might have, and we engineer the lectures and labs to preview any expected questions and also those of the unexpected variety. But you have to ask them. To do this, you need to have a look ahead and identify anything that needs clarification.\nRemember, a lack of preparation on your part is not an emergency on my part.\nLectures are pretty straightforward. The content will be released a week prior to the timetabled session, and will comprise both a prepare summary like this, but also the lecture slides and signposts to key readings.\nReview the lecture slides, have a poke around in the readings and try to familiarise yourself with any concepts that may be new to you. But the major point of the lectures is that you come along, pin back your ears, and engage with the content. More on that in the Module Overview.\nYou have a 2 hour lab each week, and although there will be some guided activities and skills shared, these sessions are ‘working sessions’ - designed to allow you to work productively on your Mini-Dissertations individually, or more usually, in your groups. It is expected that you coordinate with your group between classes, it’s not a great use of the session to use that to catch everyone up on things and have a bit of bants. 2 hours of industry will keep you moving through the stages of the module well, reducing the amount of time you might need to work independently, or more realistically, freeing that up for other things you need to prioritise, whether it’s work, life, love or another piece of coursework.\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
