I will only open a zoom for\nvirtual attendance on an individual case-by-case basis for specific\nexcusable absences (e.g. illness, family matters, etc.). Lectures will\n**not** be recorded. In-person attendance is critical as we will spend a\nlot of time working on problems and writing code during class. If you\nhave any questions or need special accommodations, send me a message on\nslack and we can discuss.\n\n# Course Description\n\n## GW Bulletin Description (short)\n\nIntroduction to exploratory data analysis using the [R programming\nlanguage](https://www.r-project.org/); data visualization, data\ncleaning, exploratory analysis, information communication, rmarkdown,\nreproducibility.\n\n## Unofficial Description\n\n```         \n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n```         \n```\n\n# Learning Objectives\n\n```         \n```\n\n# Pep Talk!\n\nWorking in and learning a programming language can be as challenging as\nlearning a new spoken language. Hadley Wickham (chief data scientist at\nRStudio and author of many amazing R packages you'll be using) [made\nthis wise\nobservation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):\n\n> It's easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and\n> think, \"Oh it's me, I'm really stupid,\" or, \"I'm not made out to\n> program.\" But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets\n> frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code.\n> It's just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone\n> and gets less and less over time. Don't blame yourself. Just take a\n> break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you're finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against\na wall and not understanding, **take a break**, talk to classmates, ask\nquestions in Slack, and try it again later.\n\n**I promise, you can do this**\n\n## Quizzes\n\nThere will be 5 quizzes given about once every other week immediately at\nthe beginning of class. You will not be told in advance when there is a\nquiz, and make up quizzes will not be available if you miss it (except\nfor excused absences). Please show up on time to class each week to\nensure that you do not miss a quiz.\n\nQuizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and\nassignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz. Quizzes are\n**short** (5-10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to\ndemonstrate where additional study is needed. **Quizzes are\nlow-stakes** - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small\nportion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as\nfeedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\n> **Why quiz at all?** Research shows that giving small quizzes\n> throughout a class can dramatically help with *retention*. It's a\n> phenomenon known as the \"retrieval effect\" - basically, you have to\n> *practice* remembering things, otherwise your brain won't remember\n> them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the\n> book [\"Make It Stick: The Science of Successful\n> Learning,\"](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674729018)\n> by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel.\n\n## Homework\n\nStudents will be responsible for two types of assignments throughout the\nsemester:\n\n-   **Weekly Assignments**: Each week, students will be assigned\n    specific readings and exercises to prepare for the next class\n    period. Students will need to submit responses that include a\n    thoughtful reflection on these concepts each week.\n-   **Mini Projects**: There will be three mini projects throughout the\n    semester designed to provide hands-on experience with the material\n    covered in class by working with and exploring real data sets and /\n    or creating visualizations. While students may work with their peers\n    on these assignments, each student must submit their own work.\n    Credit for each assignment will be allocated according to a rubric\n    provided in the assignment description.\n\n## Final Project\n\nThroughout the semester, students will work in teams of 2-3 students\ntowards a final project of an exploratory data analysis. At the end of\nthe semester, each student will submit a report of their analysis in the\nform of an html web page and create a 5 to 10-minute video presentation\nof their results. To make the overall project more manageable, it will\nbe broken down into several separate \"milestone\" deliverables due\nthroughout the semester, including a proposal, progress report,\npresentation video, and final report.\n\nView the [final project overview](project-final/0-overview.qmd) page for\nmore details.\n\n## Final Interview\n\nRather than have a final exam, each student will have a 10-minute\ninterview by the instructor. The interview will be focused on the final\nproject the student worked and will contain questions related to\nconcepts covered during the course. Students will be provided a list of\nquestions and the grading rubric ahead of the interview.\n\n# Grading\n\n## Category Breakdown\n\nFinal grades will be calculated as follows:\n\n::: {style=\"width:550px\"}\n| Item                           | Weight | Notes                     |\n|--------------------------------|--------|---------------------------|\n| Weekly HW                      | 12 %   |                           |\n| Quizzes                        | 8 %    | 5 quizzes, lowest dropped |\n| Mini Project 1                 | 8 %    | Individual assignments    |\n| Mini Project 2                 | 8 %    |                           |\n| Mini Project 3                 | 8 %    |                           |\n| Final Project: Proposal        | 9 %    | Teams of 2-3 students     |\n| Final Project: Progress Report | 12 %   |                           |\n| Final Project: Report          | 16 %   |                           |\n| Final Project: Presentation    | 9 %    |                           |\n| Final Interview                | 10 %   | Individual interview      |\n:::\n\nHere's a visual breakdown by category:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: viridisLite\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](syllabus_files/figure-html/grade-breakdown-1.png){fig-align='left' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Course Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of the term, you will...\n\n-   learn studd\n-   learn more stuff\n\n## Textbooks\n\nAll books are freely available online.
