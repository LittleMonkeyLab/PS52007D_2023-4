The Methods section is not\njust a procedural description but a showcase of your meticulous planning\nand execution of research, adhering to the principles of Open Science by\nalso attaching an Open Materials submission (to be covered later in\ndetail).\n\n## Method {.unnumbered}\n\nThe \\[method section\\] is where you describe how you conducted your\nstudy. An important principle for writing a method section is that it\nshould be clear and detailed enough that other researchers could\nreplicate the study by following your \"recipe.\" This means that it must\ndescribe all the important elements of the study---basic demographic\ncharacteristics of the participants, how they were recruited, whether\nthey were randomly assigned, how the variables were manipulated or\nmeasured, how counterbalancing was accomplished, and so on. At the same\ntime, it should avoid irrelevant details such as the fact that the study\nwas conducted in Classroom 37B of the Industrial Technology Building or\nthat the questionnaire was double-sided and completed using mechanical\npencils.\n\nThe method section begins immediately after the introduction ends with\nthe heading \"Method\" (not \"Methods\") centered on the page. Immediately\nafter this is the subheading \"Participants,\" left justified and in\nitalics. The participants subsection indicates how many participants\nthere were, the number of women and men, some indication of their age,\nother demographics that may be relevant to the study, and how they were\nrecruited, including any incentives given for participation.\n\n::: fyi\n##### APA Style and the Values of Psychology {.unnumbered}\n\nRobert Madigan and his colleagues have argued that APA style has a\npurpose that often goes unrecognized [@madigan1995language].\nSpecifically, it promotes psychologists' scientific values and\nassumptions. From this perspective, many features of APA style that at\nfirst seem arbitrary actually make good sense. Following are several\nfeatures of APA-style writing and the scientific values or assumptions\nthey reflect.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|APA style feature                                                                 |Scientific value or assumption                                                                                                                |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|There are very few direct quotations of other researchers.                        |The phenomena and theories of psychology are objective and do not depend on the specific words a particular researcher used to describe them. |\n|Criticisms are directed at other researchers’ work but not at them personally.    |The focus of scientific research is on drawing general conclusions about the world, not on the personalities of particular researchers.       |\n|There are many references and reference citations.                                |Scientific research is a large-scale collaboration among many researchers.                                                                    |\n|Empirical research reports are organized with specific sections in a fixed order. |There is an ideal approach to conducting empirical research in psychology (even if this ideal is not always achieved in actual research).     |\n|Researchers tend to “hedge” their conclusions, e.g., “The results suggest that…”  |Scientific knowledge is tentative and always subject to revision based on new empirical results.                                              |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: learningobjectives\n##### LEARNING OBJECTIVES {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Define APA style and list several of its most important\n    characteristics.\n2.  Identify three levels of APA style and give examples of each.\n3.  Identify multiple sources of information about APA style.\n:::\n\n### Purpose of the Methods Section\n\n-   The Methods section is crucial for allowing others to replicate your\n    study, ensuring the reliability and validity of your research\n    findings.\n-   A well-documented Methods section demonstrates your thorough\n    understanding of research methodologies, earning you credibility and\n    potentially higher marks.\n\n> *Research is complete only when the results are shared with the\n> scientific community.*\n>\n> --- American Psychological Association\n\n### Overview of APA 7 Formatting\n\n-   APA 7 emphasizes clarity, precision, and a bias-free language in\n    research writing. The simple way of understanding if a Methods\n    section is complete and effective is to ask yourself, \"Could Gordon\n    take my Methods section (and Open Materials) and replicate my study\n    perfectly?\". Don't include obvious information, such as the colour\n    of ink in pens or stuff I could figure out. Just the important\n    information!\n-   Consistency in formatting, such as headings, font, and citation\n    style (APA7), is key. If you are unclear on the appropriate format,\n    either use the template Gordon has provided, or refer to\n    apastyle.org for numerous examples.\n-   Use past tense to describe the methods used: \"Participants were\n    asked...\", \"The study used...\". You have completed the study after\n    all.\n\nA previous edition of the *Publication Manual* strongly discouraged the\nuse of the term *subjects* (except for nonhumans) and strongly\nencouraged the use of *participants* instead. The current edition,\nhowever, acknowledges that *subjects* can still be appropriate in\nreferring to human participants in areas in which it has traditionally\nbeen used (e.g., basic memory research). But it also encourages the use\nof more specific terms when possible: *college students*, *children*,\n*respondents*, and so on.\n\nThe third level of APA style can be referred to as [low-level style]\n(which is covered in Chapter 6 through Chapter 10 of the *Publication\nManual*.) Low-level style includes all the specific guidelines\npertaining to spelling, grammar, references and reference citations,\nnumbers and statistics, figures and tables, and so on. There are so many\nlow-level guidelines that even experienced professionals need to consult\nthe *Publication Manual* from time to time. Table \\@ref(tab:errors)\ncontains some of the most common types of APA style errors based on an\nanalysis of manuscripts submitted to one professional journal over a\n6-year period [@onwuegbuzie2010evidence]. These errors were committed by\nprofessional researchers but are probably similar to those that students\ncommit the most too. See also Note \"[Online APA Style Resources]\" in\nthis section and, of course, the *Publication Manual* itself.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Top 10 APA-Style Errors.\n\n|Error type                 |Example                                                                                                                          |\n|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|1.

However, there are also many good websites on APA style, which\ndo an excellent job of presenting the basics for beginning researchers.\nHere are two of them.\n\nAPA Style: http://www.apastyle.apa.org\n\nPurdue Online Writing Lab:\nhttps://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html\n:::\n\n## Participants\n\nIn this section, describe who participated in your study, how they were\nselected or recruited, and any demographic information relevant to your\nresearch question. If you used a nice poster, that would look great in\nyour Open Materials submission.\n\nBegin by reporting sample characteristics, sampling procedures, and\nsample size. Include demographic characteristics and be precise to aid\nestimation of generalizability. Use bias-free language and specify any\nincentives for participation.\n\nPlease be clear if you took advantage of any research participation\nschemes or synthetic or fabricated data provided by Gordon.\n\n### Sample Description\n\n-   Provide details like age, gender, ethnicity, or other relevant\n    characteristics.\n-   Example: \"The study comprised 100 undergraduate students (50%\n    female, 50% male), aged 18-25, from a South London University.\"\n-   You may also wish to include how many participants were excluded for\n    missing data (if any).\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\n-   Explain how participants gave informed consent and how you protected\n    their privacy. You will be able to demonstrate anonymisation of the\n    data in the Open Data (to be covered later!)\n-   Mention the ethical approval received from the Goldsmiths Ethics\n    Committee. Don't break anonymity by including an unredacted copy in\n    any supplementary materials!\n\n## Materials\n\nThis section covers the tools, questionnaires, or any equipment used in\nyour research. The goal is to describe the tools and techniques used for\nmeasuring ALL relevant variables. Include questionnaire or survey\nmeasures, and detail any instruments or task used, like hardware,\nsoftware, or tests. Don't repeat information, so if you Procedure\nsection includes the correct step by step information on. say, a task,\nrefer to it by name here maybe, and detail it in the procedure. Or if\nyou think there is value in detailing it here, just refer to it by name\nin the procedure section.\n\n### Instruments and Reliability\n\n-   Describe each tool used and its purpose in your research.\n-   Discuss the reliability and validity of these tools. It might be\n    worth looking back to your introduction to see if it is worth\n    including any findings associated with the tests you have used. Most\n    people don't cover the merits of the choice of measurement tools\n    when reviewing previous research.\n-   Example: \"The Big Five Personality Test (reference in APA format),\n    with a Cronbach's alpha of .82, was used to assess \\[x, y\\]\n    personality traits\"\n\n### Open Materials\n\n-   Briefly note that detailed discussion on Open Materials is covered\n    in a different section, but highlight their importance in enhancing\n    replicability and transparency of research.\n-   Example: \"Details on the questionnaires used, including their full\n    text, are provided in the Open Materials section.\"\n\n## Procedure\n\nDetail every step taken in your research, especially how you implemented\nthe 2x2 ANOVA, to allow for replication.\n\n### Detailed Description\n\n-   Start from the initial setup and move through to the data collection\n    phase.\n-   For a 2x2 ANOVA, specify the factors (independent variables) and\n    their levels.\n-   Example: \"Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups\n    (2x2 design: Factor A \\[Level 1, Level 2\\], Factor B \\[Level 1,\n    Level 2\\]). The response time was measured following the\n    presentation of stimuli.\"\n\n### Pilot Studies\n\n-   If applicable, describe any pilot study and its influence on the\n    main study.\n-   Example: \"A pilot study with 20 participants was conducted to test\n    the feasibility of the experimental design. Based on the pilot\n    results, minor adjustments were made to the instructions given to\n    participants.\"\n\n## Design\n\nExplain the research design and clarify the variables involved in your\nstudy.\n\nYou have 2 IVs and a single continuous DV. It is important to present\nhow your IVs were categorised, so if you used a median split to turn a\ncontinuous measure into a categorical IV - make that clear here.\n\n### Research Design\n\n-   Emphasize that your study is quantitative and primarily uses a 2x2\n    ANOVA design.\n-   You will have used a between-groups design, a repeated-measures\n    design or a mixed design, make this clear, and if mixed, which IV is\n    which!\n-   It can be a good idea to explain why this design was chosen for your\n    research question.\n\n### Variables\n\n-   Define your independent variables (the two factors in your ANOVA -\n    each with 2 levels) and your dependent variable (what you measured).\n-   Example: \"The independent variables were age group (young, old using\n    a median split on Age \\[median 25 yrs\\]) and treatment type\n    (treatment, control). The dependent variable was memory recall\n    accuracy (percentage correct).\"\n\n## Keeping design and procedure separate!\n\nWhat is the difference between design and procedure? The design of a\nstudy is its overall structure. What were the independent and dependent\nvariables? Was the independent variable manipulated, and if so, was it\nmanipulated between or within subjects? How were the variables\noperationally defined? The procedure is how the study was carried out.\nIt often works well to describe the procedure in terms of what the\nparticipants did rather than what the researchers did. For example, the\nparticipants gave their informed consent, read a set of instructions,\ncompleted a block of four practice trials, completed a block of 20 test\ntrials, completed two questionnaires, and were debriefed and excused.\n\n## Data Preparation (optional section if merited)\n\nIf you had any complex preprocessing steps, of which you were proud,\nsuch as 'coding' of responses, or calculating Implicit measures or\nStroop results, discuss how you processed that. .\n\n### Statistical Analysis will be covered in the Results section\n\n-   This will comprise Descriptive Stats, Inferential stats (including\n    Assumptions tests and post-hoc tests), as well as tables and\n    figures. You do not need to include any of these things in the\n    methods section.\n\n### Open Materials and Open Data (to be covered later)\n\n-   Mention that Open Materials and Open Data will be included and so\n    can be referred to. Let the reader know that they are available,\n    like appendices.\n-   Example: \"The anonymised dataset generated from this study, along\n    with the Materials necessary to replicate the study, are available\n    in the Open Data & Open Materials supplements, ensuring transparency\n    and reproducibility of the findings.\"\n\n### Ethical Compliance\n\n-   Describe the process of obtaining ethical clearance and how you\n    adhered to ethical guidelines throughout the study.\n-   Example: \"Ethical clearance was obtained from the XYZ University\n    Ethics Committee, and all research activities were conducted in\n    accordance with appropriate Ethics committee and BPS guidance.\"\n\n## Writing Style and Formatting\n\nGuidelines for effectively communicating your methods in line with APA 7\nstandards.\n\n### Tips for Writing\n\n-   **Use simple, understandable language** and explain specific terms.\n-   **Write in Active Voice.**\n-   Titles of subsections can be *italicized* and centered.\n-   Additional subsections, like \"Equipment,\" can be added if necessary.\n-   Ensure **information sources are credible**.\n-   Include only relevant information and omit details that don't affect\n    the experiment's replication.\n-   **Write in Past Tense.**\n-   Carefully **edit and proofread** to avoid errors.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n-   Overloading with unnecessary details that do not contribute to\n    replicability.\n-   Failing to use **bias-free language**.\n-   Not being precise in the description of materials and procedures,\n    including references or sources.\n-   Incorrect use of **APA formatting and style**, especially in\n    headings and subheadings.\n\n### Methods Section Awesomeness Checklist\n\n#### 1.
