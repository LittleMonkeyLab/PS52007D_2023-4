It's going to be a great adventure!\n\n## A 'warm up' for your Y3 Dissertation\n\n::: small\n-   The same 20-week timeline\n-   The same skills and techniques you will need\n-   Careful step-by-step guidance and support in the lab setting\n-   Scaled-down experiments and write-ups\n-   The security of working in a group\n-   Tips and advice from world-class researchers\n-   Opportunity to think carefully about your final year Dissertation,\n    and how to crush it!!\n:::\n\n## Support and guidance\n\n-   Gordon Wright (Module Coordinator and floating Enthusiast in Chief)\n-   7 gobsmackingly amazing Lab Tutors\n-   Your Personal Tutor and your PT group\n-   AND EACH OTHER!!\n\nThis is a team-sport\n\n## me\n\nI will be in every Research Methods lecture and I have a Student Hour\nfrom 3-4 every Monday, before we all go to the Design & Analysis\nlecture. Yup! Me too!\n\nAvailable at g.wright\\@gold.ac.uk\n\nI genuinely could not imagine anything I would rather do than this.\nPlease talk to me! Help me get to know you!\n\n## Module weighting and assessment\n\nResearch Methods is a core module with a 30 credit weighting\n\nThis means that in order to progress to Y3, you must pass all 3\nassessment elements:\n\n-   ::: takeaway\n    -   Critical Proposal 1,800 words (15%)\n\n    -   Mini-Dissertation 2,500 words (70%)\n\n    -   CHIP Learning Log 1,200 words (15%)\n    :::\n\n## A friendly warning\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Warning\n\nAll coursework is [INDIVIDUAL]{.shout} and subject to normal plagiarism\nand collusion rules\n:::\n\n## Module structure\n\n1 x 1 hr Lecture per week (Monday)\n\n1 x 2 hr Lab per week (Tuesday)\n\n4 x Personal Tutor meetings across the year\n\n## Weekly Structure\n\nEach week there will be a very brief '**Preparation**' designed to\nintroduce the main topics of the week\n\n**Lecture** (slides a week ahead and recording posted afterwards)\n\n**Labs**\n\n-   Broad structure, but for you to use to advantage\n-   Attendance QR code up for 15 minutes, and the first 15 minutes is\n    for you to get yourself sorted out as a group\n-   Your Lab Tutor will give a 10-15 minute overview of what you could\n    be doing, and a survey of the resources/materials provided\n-   If you need support, make yourself known as your Lab Tutor (or I)\n    tour the lab(s)\n-   You can (and should) ask any questions that occur to you. The labs\n    are for this purpose. Your Lab Tutor will not be responding to\n    emails outside of lab sessions\n-   Lots can be achieved in the labs, but independent study and\n    coordinated group work will be required\n\n[NO EXAM]{.shout}\n\n## Coursework\n\nThe courseworks ALL require critical reflection and metacognitive\npractice. This will be discussed in a number of lectures, but it\ncontributes to effective learning and your integration of the skills and\nexperience of doing this research exercise.\n\n## Time management and teamwork\n\n..will both be required.\n\nI ask you to see both as an opportunity to develop these important\nskills.\n\nYou will see we have some ideas to make this more relevant to careers\nand employability\n\nIt is easier to 'keep up than to catch up'.\n\n## Resources\n\nWe will be releasing a series of valuable resources to help you through\nevery step of the process\n\nThese will have value for your final year dissertation too.\n\nContribution to and comment on these is welcome and hoped for!\n\nOpen Educational Resources will be used extensively, and most core\nreadings are available online via the library.\n\n<!-- ## Prelude 1 -->\n\n<!-- We are starting off very easy. A short questionnaire to allow us to get -->\n\n<!-- to know you a little better, which we will use to develop the first -->\n\n<!-- lecture, and the course more generally. -->\n\n## Thank you for your time\n\nAnd have an amazing year!\n\nThe Research Methods Team\n\n## References\n",
