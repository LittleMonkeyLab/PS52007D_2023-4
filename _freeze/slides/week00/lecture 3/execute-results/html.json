It's going to be a great adventure!\n\n## A 'warm up' for your Y3 Dissertation\n\n::: small\n-   The same 20-week timeline\n-   The same skills and techniques you will need\n-   Careful step-by-step guidance and support in the lab setting\n-   Scaled-down experiments and write-ups\n-   The security of working in a group\n-   Tips and advice from world-class researchers\n-   Opportunity to think carefully about your final year Dissertation,\n    and how to crush it!!\n:::\n\n## Support and guidance\n\n-   Gordon Wright (Module Coordinator and floating Enthusiast in Chief)\n-   6 gobsmackingly amazing Lab Tutors\n-   Your Personal Tutor and your PT group\n-   AND EACH OTHER!!\n\nThis is a team-sport\n\n## me\n\nI will be in every Research Methods lecture and I have a Student Hour\nfrom 1-2(tbc) every Monday.\n\nAvailable at g.wright\\@gold.ac.uk\n\nI genuinely couldn't imagine anything I would rather do that this.\nPlease talk to me and help me get to know you!\n\n## Module weighting and assessment\n\nResearch Methods has a 30 credit weighting, meaning that the\nMini-Dissertation contributes 10x the developmental essay. Keep that in\nmind.\n\nTo pass, you must pass all 3 assessment elements:\n\n-   ::: takeaway\n    -   Critical Proposal 1,800 words (15%)\n\n    -   Mini-Dissertation 2,500 words (70%)\n\n    -   CHIP Learning Log 1,200 words (15%)\n    :::\n\n## A friendly warning\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Warning\n\nAll coursework is [INDIVIDUAL]{.shout} and subject to normal plagiarism\nand collusion rules. AI can (and likely should) be used for many aspects\nof the research process, and these will be indicated and guidance\noffered. However, the use of Generative AI to produce written work that\nyou submit is not acceptable. Don't make the mistake of falling for the\nsuperficially charming output of even the more advanced LLMs, it will\nnot follow the requirements we impose, and it could hallucinate, and how\nwould you know? Don't risk it.\n:::\n\n## Module structure\n\n1 x 1 hr Lecture per week (Monday 11-12 PSH LG02 (winter term))\n\n1 x 2 hr Lab per week (Tuesday - see personal timetable)\n\n4 x Personal Tutor meetings across the year\n\n## Weekly Structure\n\nEach week there will be a very brief **Overview** to set out the main\ntopics and to give you a set of milestones or preparatory activities\ndesigned to keep you on track.\n\n**Lecture** (slides available as a Reveal Slideshow via Quarto and as\npdf, docx, and if you wish for anything else, please just ask.)\n\n## Labs\n\n![Lab structure](images/LabSession.drawio.png)\n\n-   **Lab Notebook** - find a solution that works for you, but make sure\n    that you have it every week, so a cloud-based system would be best.\n    You will be expected to show notes of your progress to your Lab\n    Tutor\n-   Lots can be achieved in the labs, but independent study and\n    coordinated group work will be required. We will be asking about\n    this aspect of the process regularly.\n\n## DangerZone\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![All hail the Kenny!](images/Kenny.jpeg)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\"You'll never say hello to you,\\\nUntil you get it on the red line overload.\\\nYou'll never know what you can do,\\\nUntil you get it up as high as you can go!\"\n\nDangerzone - Loggins, K.\n:::\n\n::: columns\nMost weeks, there will be extra morsels - called the DangerZone \\[in\nhonour of the best movie ever made (Top Gun) and the Yacht-Rock and\nfashion icon legend Kenny Loggins\\].\n:::\n:::\n\n## Highway to the Dangerzone\n\nDangerZone are opportunities to consider aspects of research procedure\nbeyond the level expected for this year, but 'on the table' for next\nyear and any future research endeavours.\n\nThey are research-based in a loose sense - they will include\nprogramming, literature search and management, academic and knowledge\nmanagement tools, tips and hacks that might (or might not) be of\ninterest or useful.\n\nIf the term is going well, they might even be fun. All ideas welcome.\n\n## Coursework\n\nThe courseworks ALL require critical reflection and meta-cognitive\npractice. This will be discussed in a number of lectures, but it\ncontributes to effective learning and your integration of the skills and\nexperience of doing this research exercise.\n\n## Time management and teamwork\n\n..will both be required.\n\nI ask you to see both as an opportunity to develop these important\nskills.\n\nYou will see we have some ideas to make this more relevant to careers\nand employability\n\nIt is easier to 'keep up than to catch up'.\n\n## Resources\n\nWe will be releasing a series of valuable resources to help you through\nevery step of the process\n\nThese will have value for your final year dissertation too.\n\nContribution to and comment on these is welcome and hoped for!\n\nOpen Educational Resources will be used extensively, and most core\nreadings are available online via the library.\n\n## Before Lab 1, please...\n\nAdd an email signature to your college email, including your student\nnumber, programme, lab tutor, and personal tutor. It will speed up\nresponses to any emails you send to staff.\n\n## Thank you for your time\n\nAnd have an amazing year!\n\nThe Research Methods Team\n",
