We will talk about\n[R, RStudio and Python](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/academy/) a\nlittle bit this year.\n\n::: callout-note\nSlides, worksheets and the Website for the Module are all written using\nthis system.\n:::\n\nIt automatically creates pdf, pptx, docs, html (and more) versions of\nthe material, and is accessible and can combine complex calculations and\nwritten work, whether journal articles, presentations, or websites. You\nwill see lots of this in action this year, but it is the new\ngold-standard for scientific publishing and teaching material\nproduction, and I have been using it for the last couple of years.\n\nIf you wonder how to work the slideshows that appear in the VLE like\nthis yourself, here is a cheatsheet. You can navigate with the Arrow\nkeys, and you can get an overview or go fullscreen with `O` and `F`\nrespectively. Give it a shot if you are viewing this embedded in the\nVLE, or choose the RevealJS format in the right hand menu if you are on\nthe website!\\\n\nI shall be using these exact materials in the lectures and labs, so\nplease feel free to ask any questions, or to ask for any changes.\n\n![](images/RevealKeyBoardShortcuts.png)\n\n## Accessibility is important\n\nBecause this system uses markdown (text files) as input, rather than\nproprietary software formats like PowerPoint, it can be translated and\ntransferred very easily.\n\nThe first couple of slides looked like this when I wrote them, and I can\nupdate them on my phone if I want and publish them to the website\nautomatically in all formats.\n\n![](images/Markdown%20example@2x.png)\n\n## The font I am using\n\nThe font I am using is called \"Atkinson Hyperlegible\" and was developed\nby the Braille Institute in 2022 to make materials more easily viewed by\nanyone with impaired vision, dyslexia, or with screen-readers. Have a\nlook here [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont)\n\n## Colours\n\nI am colour blind and so I have used an app to assess the contrast for\nall colours used on the site and the materials I produce. I have chosen\nViva Magenta as the hero colour for the Lecture Slides and the Website -\nit was [Pantone Colour of the year in\n2023](https://www.pantone.com/uk/en/color-of-the-year/2023). The Lab\nslides use [Veri Peri (Colour of the year\n2022)](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2022).\n\n## Apologies for pictures of Dougal\n\nOnce we get up and running with the year, I shall bring Dougal (my dog)\nin to visit, assuming nobody objects. He's a good boy and I can't resist\nsharing a couple of AI generated pictures of him.\n\n![Sir Dougal](images/124.png)\n\n![SpaceCatDougal!](images/110.png)\n\n![Dougal with a laser gun!](images/183.png)\n\n## References\n",
