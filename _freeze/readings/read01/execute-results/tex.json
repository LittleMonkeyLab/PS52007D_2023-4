You can permute values in a vector using `sample()`.\n    TRUE / FALSE\n\n### Longer MCQs (`longmcq()`)\n\nWhen your answers are very long, sometimes a drop-down select box gets\nformatted oddly. You can use `longmcq()` to deal with this. Since the\nanswers are long, It's probably best to set up the options inside an R\nchunk with `echo=FALSE`.\n\n**What is a p-value?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n* (A) the probability that the null hypothesis is true  \n* (B) the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true  \n* (C) the probability of making an error in your conclusion  \n\n\n\n**What is true about a 95% confidence interval of the mean?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n* (A) if you repeated the process many times, 95% of intervals calculated in this way contain the true mean  \n* (B) there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this range  \n* (C) 95% of the data fall within this range  \n\n\n\n## Checked sections\n\nCreate sections with the class `webex-check` to add a button that hides\nfeedback until it is pressed. Add the class `webex-box` to draw a box\naround the section (or use your own styles).\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\nI am going to learn a lot: TRUE / FALSE\n\n\nWhat is a p-value? \n\n* (A) the probability that the null hypothesis is true  \n* (B) the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true  \n* (C) the probability of making an error in your conclusion  \n\n:::\n\n## Hidden solutions and hints\n\nYou can fence off a solution area that will be hidden behind a button\nusing `hide()` before the solution and `unhide()` after, each as inline\nR code. Pass the text you want to appear on the button to the `hide()`\nfunction.\n\nIf the solution is a code chunk, instead of using `hide()` and\n`unhide()`, simply set the `webex.hide` chunk option to TRUE, or set it\nto the string you wish to display on the button.\n\n**Recreate the scatterplot below, using the built-in `cars` dataset.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](read01_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>I need a hint</button>\n\n\nSee the documentation for `plot()` (`?plot`)\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<!-- note: you could also just set webex.hide to TRUE -->\n\n\n::: {.cell webex.hide='Click here to see the solution'}\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Click here to see the solution</button>\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(cars$speed, cars$dist)\n```\n\n\n</div>\n:::\n",
