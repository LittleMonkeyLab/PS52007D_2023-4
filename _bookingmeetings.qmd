Subject: Guide for Booking Meetings and Preparing Documentation

Dear \[Student's Name\],

As your supervisor, I would like to provide you with a guide on how to
book meetings with me and prepare appropriate documentation, such as
agendas and progress updates. This will help us make the most of our
meetings and ensure that we stay organized and on track throughout your
research.

1.  Booking a meeting:

To book a meeting with me, please follow these steps:

a.  Check my availability: You can find my available time slots in my
    shared calendar (link provided). Make sure you choose a time when I
    am free and that works for you.

b.  Send a meeting request: Once you have found an appropriate time,
    send me a meeting request via email, including the following
    information:

-   Proposed date and time
-   Duration of the meeting (I suggest allocating 30-60 minutes)
-   Meeting format (in-person, Zoom, Skype, or phone call)
-   A brief explanation of the purpose of the meeting (e.g., discussing
    your research proposal, seeking feedback on your methodology, etc.)

2.  Preparing an agenda:

Having a clear agenda helps us stay focused and make the most of our
time together. Please prepare an agenda and share it with me at least 24
hours before our scheduled meeting. Your agenda should include:

a.  Meeting objectives: A brief statement of what you hope to achieve
    during our meeting.

b.  Topics to discuss: A numbered list of topics or questions that you
    want to cover, in order of priority. This will help us stay on track
    and ensure that we address your most pressing concerns.

c.  Materials to review: If you would like me to review any documents
    (e.g., your research proposal, literature review, or data analysis),
    please attach them to your email and provide a brief description of
    what feedback you are seeking.

3.  Updating progress:

At the beginning of each meeting, it is helpful for you to provide a
brief update on your progress since our last meeting. This can include:

a.  Completed tasks: List any milestones or tasks that you have
    accomplished, such as completing a literature review, submitting an
    ethics application, or conducting interviews.

b.  Challenges encountered: Discuss any challenges or obstacles that you
    have faced, and suggest possible solutions or areas where you need
    further guidance.

c.  Next steps: Outline your plans for moving forward, including your
    short-term and long-term goals.

By following this guide, we can ensure that our meetings are productive
and efficient. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not
hesitate to reach out to me.

Looking forward to our next meeting!

Best regards,

\[Your Name\] \[Your Title\] \[Your Department\] \[Your Institution\]
