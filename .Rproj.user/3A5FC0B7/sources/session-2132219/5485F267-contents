# Method Section

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Learning Objectives

1.  Review the key features of a complete Method section in APA reports
2.  Identify key information required for each sub-section in the
    Mini-Dissertation method section
3.  Offset common errors and ensure good pre-submission checking
:::

## Talking Methods

In this chapter, you will learn how to craft a comprehensive and clear
Methods section for your mini-dissertation. The Method section is not
just a procedural description but a showcase of your meticulous planning
and execution of research, adhering to the principles of Open Science by
also attaching an Open Materials submission (to be covered later in
detail).

## Method {.unnumbered}

The method section is where you describe how you conducted your study.
An important principle for writing a method section is that it should be
clear and detailed enough that other researchers could replicate the
study by following your "recipe." This means that it must describe all
the important elements of the study---basic demographic characteristics
of the participants, how they were recruited, whether they were randomly
assigned, how the variables were manipulated or measured, how
counterbalancing was accomplished, and so on. At the same time, it
should avoid irrelevant details such as the fact that the study was
conducted in Classroom 37B of the Industrial Technology Building or that
the questionnaire was double-sided and completed using mechanical
pencils.

The method section begins immediately after the introduction ends with
the heading "Method" (not "Methods" - I'm always making that mistake!)
centered on the page. Immediately after this is the subheading
"Participants," left justified and in italics. The participants
subsection indicates how many participants there were, the number of
male, female and other/prefer not to say (or any response options you
offered), some indication of their age, other demographics that may be
relevant to the study, and how they were recruited, including any
incentives given for participation.

## APA Style and the Values of Psychology

Robert Madigan and his colleagues have argued that APA style has a
purpose that often goes unrecognized [@madigan1995language].
Specifically, it promotes psychologists' scientific values and
assumptions. From this perspective, many features of APA style that at
first seem arbitrary actually make good sense. Following are several
features of APA-style writing and the scientific values or assumptions
they reflect.

```{r values, echo = FALSE, }
feature <- c("There are very few direct quotations of other researchers.",
             "",
             "Criticisms are directed at other researchers’ work but not at them personally.",
             "",
             "There are many references and reference citations.","","Empirical research reports are organized with specific sections in a fixed order.",
             "",
             "Researchers tend to “hedge” their conclusions, e.g., “The results suggest that…”")
value <- c("The phenomena and theories of psychology are objective and do not depend on the specific words a particular researcher used to describe them.",
           "",
           "The focus of scientific research is on drawing general conclusions about the world, not on the personalities of particular researchers.",
           "",
           "Scientific research is a large-scale collaboration among many researchers.",
           "",
           "There is an ideal approach to conducting empirical research in psychology (even if this ideal is not always achieved in actual research).",
           "",
           "Scientific knowledge is tentative and always subject to revision based on new empirical results.")
values <- data.frame(feature,value)

knitr::kable(values,
  col.name=c("APA style feature","Scientific value or assumption"))

### Purpose of the Method Section

-   The Method section is crucial for allowing others to replicate your
    study, ensuring the reliability and validity of your research
    findings.
-   A well-documented Method section demonstrates your thorough
    understanding of research methodologies, earning you credibility and
    potentially higher marks.

### Overview of APA 7 Formatting

-   APA7 emphasizes clarity, precision, and a bias-free language in
    research writing. The simple way of understanding if a Method
    section is complete and effective is to ask yourself, "Could Gordon
    take my Method section (and Open Materials) and replicate my study
    perfectly?". Don't include obvious information, such as the colour
    of ink in pens or stuff I could figure out. Just the important
    information!
-   Consistency in formatting, such as headings, font, and citation
    style (APA7), is key. If you are unclear on the appropriate format,
    either use the template Gordon has provided, or refer to
    apastyle.org for numerous examples.
-   Use past tense to describe the methods used: "Participants were
    asked...", "The study used...". You have completed the study after
    all.

A previous edition of the *Publication Manual* strongly discouraged the
use of the term *subjects* (except for nonhumans) and strongly
encouraged the use of *participants* instead. But it also encourages the
use of more specific terms when possible: *college students*,
*children*, *respondents*, and so on. If in doubt, refer to
PARTICIPANTS!

Table 2 (below) contains some of the most common types of APA style
errors based on an analysis of manuscripts submitted to one professional
journal over a 6-year period [@onwuegbuzie2010evidence]. These errors
were committed by professional researchers but are probably similar to
those that students commit the most too. See also Note "\[O\]" in this
section and, of course, the *Publication Manual* itself.

```{r errors, echo = FALSE, }
error <- c("1. Use of numbers","2. Hyphenation","3. Use of et al.","4. Headings","5. Use of since","6. Tables and figures","7. Use of commas","8. Use of abbreviations","9. Spacing","10. Use of & in references")
example <- c("Failing to use numerals for 10 and above","Failing to hyphenate compound adjectives that precede a noun (e.g., “role playing technique” should be “role-playing technique”)","Failing to use it in a reference","Not capitalizing headings correctly","Using since to mean because","Not formatting them in APA style; repeating information that is already given in the text","Failing to use a comma before and or or in a series of three or more elements","Failing to spell out a term completely before introducing an abbreviation for it","Not consistently double-spacing between lines","Using & in the text or *and* in parentheses")
errors <- data.frame(error,example)

  col.name=c("Error type","Example"), caption = 'Top 10 APA-Style Errors.')

## Online APA Style Resources again 🤓

The best source of information on APA style is the *Publication Manual*
itself. However, there are also many good websites on APA style, which
do an excellent job of presenting the basics for beginning researchers.
Here are two of them.

## Participants

In this section, describe who participated in your study, how they were
selected or recruited, and any demographic information relevant to your
research question. If you used a nice poster, that would look great in
your Open Materials submission.

Begin by reporting sample characteristics, sampling procedures, and
sample size. Include demographic characteristics and be precise to aid
estimation of generalizability. Use bias-free language and specify any
incentives for participation.

Please be clear if you took advantage of any research participation
schemes or synthetic or fabricated data provided by Gordon.

### Sample Description

-   Provide details like age, gender, ethnicity, or other relevant
    characteristics.
-   Example: "The study comprised 100 undergraduate students (50%
    female, 50% male), aged 18-25, from a South London University."
-   You may also wish to include how many participants were excluded for
    missing data (if any).

### Ethical Considerations

-   Explain how participants gave informed consent and how you protected
    their privacy. You will be able to demonstrate anonymisation of the
    data in the Open Data (to be covered later!)
-   Mention the ethical approval received from the Goldsmiths Ethics
    Committee. Don't break anonymity by including an unredacted copy in
    any supplementary materials!

## Materials

This section covers the tools, questionnaires, or any equipment used in
your research. The goal is to describe the tools and techniques used for
measuring ALL relevant variables. Include questionnaire or survey
measures, and detail any instruments or task used, like hardware,
software, or tests. Don't repeat information, so if you Procedure
section includes the correct step by step information on. say, a task,
refer to it by name here maybe, and detail it in the procedure. Or if
you think there is value in detailing it here, just refer to it by name
in the procedure section.

### Instruments and Reliability

-   Describe each tool used and its purpose in your research.
-   Discuss the reliability and validity of these tools. It might be
    worth looking back to your introduction to see if it is worth
    including any findings associated with the tests you have used. Most
    people don't cover the merits of the choice of measurement tools
    when reviewing previous research.
-   Example: "The Big Five Personality Test (reference in APA format),
    with a Cronbach's alpha of .82, was used to assess \[x, y\]
    personality traits"

### Open Materials

-   Briefly note that detailed discussion on Open Materials is covered
    in a different section, but highlight their importance in enhancing
    replicability and transparency of research.
-   Example: "Details on the questionnaires used, including their full
    text, are provided in the Open Materials section."

## Procedure

Detail every step taken in your research, especially how you implemented
the 2x2 ANOVA, to allow for replication.

### Detailed Description

-   Start from the initial setup and move through to the data collection
    phase.
-   For a 2x2 ANOVA, specify the factors (independent variables) and
    their levels.
-   Example: "Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups
    (2x2 design: Factor A \[Level one, Level two\], Factor B \[Level
    one, Level two\]). The response time was measured following the
    presentation of stimuli."

### Pilot Studies

-   If applicable, describe any pilot study and its influence on the
    main study.
-   Example: "A pilot study with four classmates was conducted to test
    the feasibility of the experimental design. Based on the pilot
    results, minor adjustments were made to ensure the clarity of
    instructions given to participants (see Open Materials for
    instruction sheet)."

## Design

Explain the research design and clarify the variables involved in your
study.

You have 2 IVs and a single continuous DV. It is important to present
how your IVs were categorised, so if you used a median split to turn a
continuous measure into a categorical IV - make that clear here.

### Research Design

-   Emphasize that your study is quantitative and primarily uses a 2x2
    ANOVA design.
-   You will have used a between-groups design, a repeated-measures
    design or a mixed design, make this clear, and if mixed, which IV is
    which!
-   It can be a good idea to explain why this design was chosen for your
    research question.

### Variables

-   Define your independent variables (the two factors in your ANOVA -
    each with 2 levels) and your dependent variable (what you measured).
-   Example: "The independent variables were age group (young, old using
    a median split on Age \[median 25 yrs\]) and treatment type
    (treatment, control). The dependent variable was memory recall
    accuracy (percentage correct)."

## Keeping design and procedure separate!

What is the difference between design and procedure?

-   The design of a study is its overall structure.
-   What were the independent and dependent variables?
-   Was the independent variable manipulated, and if so, was it
    manipulated between or within subjects?
-   How were the variables operationally defined?

The procedure is how the study was carried out.

-   It often works well to describe the procedure in terms of what the
    participants did rather than what the researchers did.
-   For example, the participants gave their informed consent, read a
    set of instructions, completed a block of four practice trials,
    completed a block of 12 test trials[^1], completed two
    questionnaires, and were debriefed and excused.

[^1]: Note four and 12 above. See APA Style - One to nine are spelled
    out, 10 + can be written as digits!

## Data Preparation (optional section if merited)

If you had any complex preprocessing steps, of which you were proud,
such as 'coding' of responses, or calculating Implicit measures or
Stroop results, discuss how you processed that. .

### Statistical Analysis will be covered in the Results section

-   This will comprise Descriptive Stats, Inferential stats (including
    Assumptions tests and post-hoc tests), as well as tables and
    figures. You do not need to include any of these things in the
    method section.

### Open Materials and Open Data (to be covered later)

-   Mention that Open Materials and Open Data will be included and so
    can be referred to. Let the reader know that they are available,
    like appendices.
-   Example: "The anonymised dataset generated from this study, along
    with the Materials necessary to replicate the study, are available
    in the Open Data & Open Materials supplements, ensuring transparency
    and reproducibility of the findings."

### Ethical Compliance

-   Describe the process of obtaining ethical clearance and how you
    adhered to ethical guidelines throughout the study.
-   Example: "Ethical clearance was obtained from the XYZ University
    Ethics Committee, and all research activities were conducted in
    accordance with appropriate Ethics committee and BPS guidance."
