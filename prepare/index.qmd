# How to prepare for each week in Research Methods

Many hundreds of years ago, I was a Boy Scout, before that, I was a
Brownie too, but that's a story for another day. 'Be Prepared' is a
valuable piece of advice. And that's what I'm trying to help with here.
You aren't going to get the most out of the timetabled sessions, or your
extensive independent study, if you don't have a fair idea of what you
need to do, by when, and what each activity entails.

Your teaching team goes to a great deal of effort to answer any and all
questions you might have, and we engineer the lectures and labs to
preview any expected questions and also those of the unexpected variety.
But you have to ask them. To do this, you need to have a look ahead and
identify anything that needs clarification.

Remember, a lack of preparation on your part is not an emergency on my
part.

Lectures are pretty straightforward. The content will be released a week
prior to the timetabled session, and will comprise both a `prepare`
summary like this, but also the lecture slides and signposts to key
readings.

Review the lecture slides, have a poke around in the readings and try to
familiarise yourself with any concepts that may be new to you. But the
major point of the lectures is that you come along, pin back your ears,
and engage with the content. More on that in the Module Overview.

You have a 2 hour lab each week, and although there will be some guided
activities and skills shared, these sessions are 'working sessions' -
designed to allow you to work productively on your Mini-Dissertations
individually, or more usually, in your groups. It is expected that you
coordinate with your group between classes, it's not a great use of the
session to use that to catch everyone up on things and have a bit of
bants. 2 hours of industry will keep you moving through the stages of
the module well, reducing the amount of time you might need to work
independently, or more realistically, freeing that up for other things
you need to prioritise, whether it's work, life, love or another piece
of coursework.
