## clean templates

## Example slide {.refbox}

### This is a subtitle

Here we have some text that may run over several lines of the slide
frame, depending on how long it is.

-   first item
    -   A sub item

Next, we'll brief review some theme-specific components.

-   Note that *all* of the standard Reveal.js
    [features](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) can be
    used with this theme, even if we don't highlight them here.

## Additional theme classes {.footerbox}

### Some extra things you can do with the clean theme

Special classes for emphasis

-   `.alert` class for default emphasis, e.g. [important note]{.alert}.
-   `.fg` class for custom colour, e.g. [important note]{.fg
    style="--col: #e64173"}.
-   `.bg` class for custom background, e.g. [important note]{.bg
    style="--col: #e64173"}.

Cross-references

-   `.button` class provides a Beamer-like button, e.g.
    [[Summary](#sec-summary)]{.button}

fast as possible.

We provide a separate [demo
template](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo),
with more examples for integrating code, tables, figures, etc.

-   See the live demo slides
    [here](https://grantmcdermott.com/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo/template.html).

## cleft cright

Here's some good old text

::: cleft
cleft stuff Gullibility has started to be studied due to the fact it
gives valuable insights into human behaviour, cognition, and
decision-making processes. Gullibility study has practical applications
within different fields, such as psychology, sociology, marketing, and
public policy. The study of factors affecting gullibility has also been
conducted to create a precise psychological profile of individuals prone
to being gullible. Therefore, emotional intelligence (Baker et al.,
2013; Young et al., 2015), social intelligence (Hart et al., 2021;
Teunisse et al., 2020) trust (Baker et al., 2013; Hamby et al., 2021;
Rotter, 1967; Rotter, 1980; Teunisse et al., 2020: Yamagishi et al.,
1999), personality factors (Begue et al., 2015; George et al., 2020;
Gore et al., 2012; Peace et al., 2011; Teunisse et al., 2020), facial
representation (Jaeger & Meral, 2022) and overall poor decision-making
mechanisms have been included. The benefit of studying gullibility lies
in the need to determine and safeguard individuals who are likely to
fall for deceptive speech, online as well as face to face.
