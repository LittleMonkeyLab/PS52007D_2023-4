# Overview of today's lab activities

1.  Review the Ethics Page on the VLE

2.  Sign up for a Qualtrics account here
    <https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/login>

3.  Review the Template Qualtrics file for an example Information sheet,
    consent and debrief

## Exciting progress so far!

You've identified an exciting area of research and critically evaluated
a relevant paper.

Time to put all that hard work and careful thought into practice.

Between now and the end of term, you will build and obtain ethical
approval for your studies.

We are all in the process of marking Critical Proposals, and we are
seeing some wonderful application of the topics and concepts raised in
the module so far.

Some of you are making impressive claims about what you are going to do.
Fantastic!

## Don't push too hard, yet! 

Please remember, this is supposed to be a modest size project, with
focus on following the steps from initial idea, critique, development,
Ethics, data collection and preparation, analysis and write-up.

We don't want any single step to be too daunting or labour-intensive. We
want you to enjoy the process as much as possible, and think carefully
about each step.

## The Mini-Dissertation 'rules'

Your ultimate individually written up Mini-Dissertation project MUST
conform to the following definitive rules:

-   	2x2 ANOVA design with 2 categorical IVs (each with 2 levels) and a
    single continuous DV
-   	You must obtain ethical approval and prove individual involvement in
    the process of application
-   	You must make a sample size estimation / Power calculation
-   	You must collect data online and individually contribute to group
    data collection efforts
-   	Your Mini-Dissertation final submission must comprise:

## Submission Requirements

-   a 2500 word APA7 empirical paper with a critical reflection and
    complete reference list

-   Open Data - a single, cleaned, clearly-labelled data set in Excel
    format

-   Open Materials - a complete, replication-ready materials document
    detailing materials relevant to your submission

# Running Experiments online or face to face

## Comparing Experiment Modalities

-   Online Surveys and Experiments
    -   Qualtrics - For surveys, stimulus presentation that don't
        require accurate timing
    -   Gorilla.sc - For 'experimental' tasks with complex stimulus \>
        presentation or that require response time measures or
        push-button \> responses etc.
-   Face-to-Face Experiments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Online Surveys and Experiments with Qualtrics

### Overview

-   A powerful tool for creating and distributing online surveys
-   Widely used in psychological research
-   We have an institutional licence and so it is FREE
-   No specialist support - has excellent online support

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pros of Qualtrics

### Accessibility

-   Reach a wide, diverse audience (if necessary)
-   Accessible by anyone with a phone or laptop etc

### Cost-Effective

-   Low 'cost' compared to face-to-face

### Data Management

-   Automated data collection, scoring and storage
-   Relatively easy to analyze and export data - but not always simple

### Customization

-   Highly customizable surveys and experiments (video, photos, audio,
    vignettes)
-   Supports various question types and logic

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cons of Qualtrics

### Limited Human Interaction

-   Lack of personal interaction can affect responses
-   You put a huge amount of trust in the participant
-   Not always easy to manage ethical challenges properly

### Technical Issues

-   Dependence on internet connectivity and user tech skills
-   An error in the build and you are in trouble \####

### Response Authenticity

-   Higher risk of dishonest or inattentive responses (maybe?) \####
    Sampling Bias
-   Potential for non-representative samples

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction to experiments using Gorilla.sc

### Gorilla.sc: highly controlled online Psychological Research

-   A comprehensive online tool for behavioral research
-   Facilitates creation, deployment, and analysis of experiments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Features of Gorilla.sc

### User-Friendly Interface

-   Intuitive design for researchers of all levels
-   Drag-and-drop experiment builder

### Requires 'tokens' to run

-   You will need to apply for 'tokens' to apply for ethics, and to run
    the study.
-   There is usually a limited supply as there is a cost associated with
    this.

### Versatile Experiment Design

-   Supports a wide range of experimental paradigms
-   Customizable to suit various research needs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Experiment Creation with Gorilla.sc

### Building Blocks

-   Use 'widgets' and 'tasks' to construct experiments
-   Easily integrate surveys, quizzes, and cognitive tasks

### Advanced Customization

-   Incorporate complex experimental logic
-   Customize with CSS and JavaScript for unique requirements

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Collection and Analysis

### Real-Time Data Collection

-   Gather data securely and efficiently
-   Access participant responses in real-time

### Analytical Tools

-   Built-in tools for basic data analysis
-   Export data for advanced analysis in other software e.g. SPSS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Collaboration and Sharing

### Team Collaboration

-   Share experiments and data with team members
-   Collaborate on experiment design and analysis

### Participant Recruitment

-   Still needs to be managed via sources outside of Gorilla

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Gorilla.sc in Psychological Research

### Broad Application

-   Suitable for cognitive, social, and clinical psychology
-   Ideal for remote and large-scale studies

### Impact on Mini-Dissertations

-   Increases the reach of psychological studies requiring complex
    stimulus or timing
-   Not easy to get up and running with this tool
-   No specialist support - has excellent templates and online support

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Face-to-Face Experiments

### Overview

-   Traditional method of conducting experiments
-   Involves direct interaction with participants

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pros of Face-to-Face Experiments

### Enhanced Interaction

-   Direct human interaction enriches data quality

### Controlled Environment

-   Better control over experimental conditions

### Immediate Feedback

-   Opportunity for immediate clarification and feedback

### Participant Authenticity

-   Lower risk of false responses (maybe?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cons of Face-to-Face Experiments

### Higher Costs

-   Greater resource and time investment (maybe?)

### Limited Reach

-   Restricted to participants' geographical location

### Time-Consuming

-   Scheduling and conducting sessions takes time

### Potential Biases

-   Risk of experimenter or social desirability biases

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

### Choosing the Right Method

-   Depends on research goals, resources, and target population
-   Both methods offer unique advantages and challenges

### Tailoring to Research Needs

-   Consider the nature of your study and participant accessibility
-   Balance between quality, 'cost', and reach

------------------------------------------------------------------------
