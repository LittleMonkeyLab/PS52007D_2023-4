## Apologies for my absence

I apologise for my unexpected absence at the end of last term.

It was unavoidable, but I shall endeavour to repay your patience this

:::

[^1]: Not really a surprise! ;-)

<!-- ![](images/paste-C9437570.png) -->

## CHIP Assignment(s)

::: incremental
-   Coursework piece designed to allow you to engage reflexively with
    the 'big picture' of your degree

-   Think about how these issues link into psychology as a discipline,
    and how they relate to your own thoughts about what psychology is or
    should be

-   Two 'reflective accounts' of max 600 words each (Not including
    obligatory reference list)

-   [**Marks are awarded for reflection**]{.underline}, evidence of
    learning and bring topics together. Please see marking criteria for
    both accounts.

-   Not looking for a restatement of the facts in the lectures etc.

-   [**They are designed to be personal and reflective -- embrace this
    aspect!**]{.underline}
:::

## Reflective Account 1

Essay 1 is based on the content of ONE of the topics and should adopt at
least two of the following 6 'perspectives'.

::: incremental
-   As a **STUDENT** of psychology

-   As a **TRAINEE** psychologist

-   In relation to a **RESEARCH** application in your future

-   As an **HISTORIAN** of psychology

-   Reporting on the culture or **PRACTICE** of psychology as it
    currently exists here or across cultures

-   As a critic or supporter of psychology's status as a **SCIENCE**
:::

## Reflective Account 1 tips

::: incremental
-   Ask a specific question -- and answer it.
-   Intro, body, conclusion structure.
-   Reflect on the topic and give your own opinion as to the answer!
-   Present a journey in your learning or appreciation of the topic
-   Ensure your answer is argued using examples
-   Use evidence in your argument from a range of sources, ideally do
    some strategic wider reading
-   Present and reference it well
:::

## Reflective Account 2

Essay 2 should focus on at least one of the OTHER topics covered in the
course.

::: incremental
-   This answer should focus on a primary reading and then any further
    reading you have done (strongly encouraged).
-   You must identify that primary reading explicitly in the essay
    itself.
-   You should not simply restate what the authors thought or found, but
    rather briefly summarise and build
-   Think about your perspective on the issues.
-   What do you think about this debate or issue? We want to know!
-   And what do you think are interesting directions for psychologists
    to take this debate or issue in the future?
:::

## Reflective Account 2 tips

::: incremental
-   Explicitly identify a single initial reading and build upon that.
-   Discuss a debate or issue that you think is interesting or important
-   Give your own opinion and how this has developed or changed as a
    result of the lecture, the course more widely, and/or the reading.
-   Argue your opinion explicitly, own it and back it up with examples
-   Use evidence in your argument from a range of sources, ideally do
    some strategic wider reading
-   Present and reference it well
:::

## Overlapping content

::: incremental
-   You can combine across different topics in Essay 2 (e.g., you could
    talk about Evolution and Consciousness, or Inclusivity and Science),
    and thinking about links between topics is strongly encouraged.
-   However, the material covered in Essay 2 must be different from
    Essay 1. Students will be penalised for covering identical topics.
:::

## Details

::: incremental
-   Due: Friday, 12 April 2024, 12:00 Noon - about 3 weeks after the end
    of term

-   n.b. Mini-Dissertation Due: Friday, 22 March 2024, 12:00 Noon

-   Both answers should be written in essay-style prose (e.g., with APA
    references where you refer to sources) put in a single document and
    submitted to the coursework submission page.

-   Max 600 words per answer (references not included in word count)

-   Remember that this only accounts for a smaller portion of the module
    grade (15%). Should hopefully be an enjoyable way to reflect on
    issues on the course you found interesting.

# Any questions?

## This term

Next term is essentially split into two halves:

Each week, we will focus on a key skill or procedure, supplying useful
resources and guidance, but leaving the rest of the lab session for
independent work, advice and support from your Lab Tutor, or anything
else you think would be helpful!

::: incremental
-   Weeks 10 -- 15 are geared towards data collection and data
    preparation

-   Weeks 16 -- 20 are geared towards analysis, writing up, and
    preparing your submission 
:::

## Weeks 10 -- 15 (alongside lectures & data collection)

::: incremental
-   In week 10 - Enrol everyone on the Study Swap system and mobilise
    for data collection
-   In week 11 - We begin the process of focusing on Writing & Analysis
-   In week 12 - We will be focusing on 'Writing up your Method section'
-   In week 13 - We will be talking about 'Planning your analysis'
-   In week 14 -- A workshop on 'Data Screening & Cleaning'
-   In week 15 -- We will be showcasing your work to the 1^st^ Years!
:::

## Remember.. Available on the VLE...

**You can find these all on the VLE in the**

**'Mini-Dissertation resources' section of the VLE**

::: incremental
-   An APA 7^th^ Edition Mini-Dissertation template word document
-   An APA 7^th^ Edition Reference Cheat Sheet
-   Extended Mini-Dissertation Marking Criteria
-   2 x Example Mini-Dissertations
:::

## APA 7 Mini-Dissertation Template

Your Mini-Dissertations must conform to the correct format. Easy marks.

**We use APA 7^th^ Edition and in the style of a professional journal
article manuscript submission.**

::: incremental
-   The word document template features all the major stylistic
    formatting you will need, with some helpful pointers throughout.
-   When you write your Mini-Dissertation, you just need to delete all
    the tips and put in your wonderfully crafted prose and results!
-   A common mistake is to deviate from the APA formatting. Please try
    not to do this! It counts.
:::

## **APA style will be the focus of Week 16.**

APA 7 Reference Cheat Sheet

::: incremental
-   A key part of APA 7^th^ Edition is reference format. **We will also
    cover this briefly in week 16**. 
-   We have already a number of other electronic resources that might
    help you ensure you follow the correct format, but in the first
    instance, this Cheat Sheet will be very handy.
:::

## Mini-Dissertation Extended Marking Criteria

Another resource we've given you today is an **extended
Mini-Dissertation Marking Criteria**.

::: incremental
-   These are the criteria used by the markers and moderators to
    calibrate marks and ensure accuracy and consistency.
-   An abbreviated version will be attached to the feedback that you
    receive.
-   You will see that there are numerous categories, but each requires
    some consideration. Have a look over this when you get some time.
-   A screencast will be provided discussing this in more detail,
    overviewing submission requirements, and highlighting common
    pitfalls, and tips for the top!
:::

## Example Mini-Dissertations

Points to attend to:

::: incremental
-   2,500 words is NOT as long as you think
-   5 paragraphs (key points) in Intro and Discussion
-   Methods section wins marks!
-   [Both examples achieved firsts, but marks were 'left on the
    table']{.border}
:::

## Closing points on the Mini-Dissertation

::: incremental
-   The reflective account is a required part of the Mini-Dissertation
-   We may be asking for a 'contribution statement'
-   Your involvement in data collection AND participation is monitored
    next term
-   Open Materials and Open Data are key parts of the submission and are
    featured in the marking
-   But it's just a lab report. You've done 3 of those already.
