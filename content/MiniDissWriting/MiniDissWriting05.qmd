# Open Data

## Open Data requirements

Open Data is the concept of making research data accessible to everyone,
promoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research -
all critical features of an Open Science. In the field of psychology,
sharing data is crucial for advancing scientific knowledge. This guide
will provide step-by-step instructions for creating an Open Data
submission for a psychology research project such as the
Mini-Dissertation (and your Final Year Dissertations for that matter!).

## Important

It is a compulsory that you submit your data. If you do not submit
something, then your submission is not complete and the mark awarded
will be impacted.

By taking the time to produce a clear Open Data submission, you will
enhance the overall quality of your submission, and this will be
reflected in your mark.
