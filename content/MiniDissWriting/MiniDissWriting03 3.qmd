# Open Materials

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the function of Open Materials in relation to Open
    Science
2.  Review example content for Open Materials
3.  Understand requirements for their own Mini-Dissertation
:::

## **Importance of Transparency in Open Research**

1.  **Enhancing Replicability and Reproducibility**: Transparency in
    research allows other scientists to replicate studies and validate
    your exciting results, which is a fundamental aspect of the
    scientific method. Open research ensures that the data and
    methodologies used are accessible to others, facilitating a deeper
    understanding of what was done and verification of research
    findings.

2.  **Building Trust in Scientific Findings**: Transparent practices in
    research foster trust among the scientific community, policymakers,
    and the public. When researchers openly share their methods and
    data, it demonstrates a commitment to honesty and integrity in their
    work.

3.  **Promoting Collaboration and Innovation**: Open research encourages
    collaborative efforts, as it allows researchers from different
    fields and geographies to access, utilize, and build upon existing
    knowledge. This cross-pollination of ideas can lead to innovative
    solutions and advancements.

4.  **Accelerating Scientific Discovery**: By making research findings
    and data openly available, the pace of scientific discovery can be
    quickened. Researchers can leverage existing work to explore new
    avenues of inquiry without duplicating efforts.

5.  **Advancing Educational Opportunities**: Open research provides
    valuable resources for education and training (maybe you benefited
    from access to Open Resources while developing your
    Mini-Dissertation?), allowing students and early-career researchers
    to access a wealth of information and learn from real-world data and
    methodologies.

### **Role of Open Materials**

1.  **Facilitating Research Transparency**: Open materials, which
    include datasets, software, protocols, and other research tools, are
    central to ensuring transparency. They allow others to understand,
    evaluate, and replicate the research process.

2.  **Standardizing Research Practices**: Open materials can help in
    standardizing procedures across studies, leading to more consistent
    and reliable research outcomes.

### **What Open Materials Need to Achieve**

1.  **Comprehensiveness**: They should provide a complete picture of the
    research process you employed, including informed consent and
    information information, tools used, and detailed methodological
    information.

2.  **Accessibility**: Materials should be easily accessible to
    researchers from various fields, irrespective of their resources.
    Don't share files that can't be viewed by anyone, such as
    pay-for-software etc. It's not such a huge deal for the
    Mini-Dissertation, but in reality, it's counter to the point if you
    share, say, an SPSS file.

3.  **Usability**: Open materials should be user-friendly, with clear
    documentation and instructions to enable effective utilization by
    others. They are designed to facilitate, not complicate!

4.  **Interoperability**: Compatibility with different platforms and
    software is crucial to ensure that a wide range of researchers can
    use these materials. Similar to 2, but distinct.

5.  **Longevity**: Ensuring that open materials are preserved for
    long-term use and remain accessible as technologies evolve. Again,
    not a big deal with a coursework submission, as they will NOT be
    published by me, but if you publish your Final Year Dissertation,
    you would want it to be long-lived!

By adhering to these principles of Openness and Collaborativeness, the
scientific community can significantly benefit from open research
practices, leading to more robust, innovative, and transparent
scientific inquiry. And less frustration/guess-work when you come to
replicate or extend work!

## Tips

Your open materials are obviously going to be specific to your own
research study. They obviously need to fully illustrate the wonderful
things that you've created in the course of your mini-dissertation.

For the purposes of the mini-dissertation, you can take one of two
approaches. You can either be extremely selfish and solely present the
materials and tools that you used to generate the data for your
individual 2x2 ANOVA, or you could view it as a mark-winning opportunity
to demonstrate the wide-ranging gorgeousness of all the things that you
and your group submitted.

For the purposes of the marking, the open materials is not a right or
wrong exercise. Make the decision of what to include yourself. But do
pay attention to what a Researcher such as myself would need to fully
understand your task and to be able to replicate it. It's fine if I
can't fully replicate something that belongs to somebody else, but I
need to be able to replicate what you produced.

And do pay attention to what goes in open materials and what goes in
open data. It is common that people have trouble working out where a
questionnaire and its associated data might go.

I want to be able to test people with the right questionnaire measure
and I would want to find the 'questionnaire' in Open Materials. But of
course, the questionnaire results will appear in open data, where a
codebook might be useful. But we'll cover that next week.

## Some examples to get ideas from

### Information sheets/consent (not the easiest to read, but useful)

### Debrief form

### Redacted Ethics and Approval

### Stimulus items

### Video Stimulus Items (the link REALLY helps!)

### A good illustration of a behaviour measure in Qualtrics

### Comprehensive Questionnaire description with notes

### If you still have a live link, or categorised continuous IVs

n.b. Treatment of IVs, data, pre-processing steps or similar *could* be
handled in Open Data. Just be clear!
