10. **Report the results**

-   In your report, include F-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and effect sizes.

### Results

A 2x2 between-subjects ANOVA was conducted to examine the effects of \[Factor 1 Name\] and \[Factor 2 Name\] on \[Dependent Variable Name\].
The independent variables were \[Factor 1 Description, e.g., gender with two levels: male and female\] and \[Factor 2 Description, e.g., treatment with two levels: control and experimental\].
The dependent variable was \[Dependent Variable Description, e.g., test scores\].

The main effect of \[Factor 1 Name\] was significant, F(1, N - 1) = \[F-Value\], p \< .05, η² = \[Effect Size\], indicating that \[brief interpretation of the result, e.g., males and females differed significantly in their test scores\].
Similarly, the main effect of \[Factor 2 Name\] was also significant, F(1, N - 1) = \[F-Value\], p \< .05, η² = \[Effect Size\], showing that \[brief interpretation, e.g., participants in the experimental group scored significantly higher than those in the control group\].

Furthermore, the interaction between \[Factor 1 Name\] and \[Factor 2 Name\] was found to be significant, F(1, N - 1) = \[F-Value\], p \< .05, η² = \[Effect Size\].
This suggests that the effect of \[Factor 1 Name\] on \[Dependent Variable Name\] depends on the level of \[Factor 2 Name\].

To further explore this interaction, post hoc tests were conducted using \[Name of Post Hoc Test, e.g., Tukey's HSD\].
The results indicated that \[describe specific findings from the post hoc tests, e.g., the difference between males and females was more pronounced in the experimental group than in the control group\].

Overall, these results suggest that both \[Factor 1 Name\] and \[Factor 2 Name\] significantly influence \[Dependent Variable Name\], and their interaction is also important in understanding the relationship between these variables.

11. **Assumption Checks**

-   Check for assumptions like normality and homogeneity of variances.
-   Use `Explore` under `Descriptive Statistics` for normality checks and `Levene's Test for Equality of Error Variances` for homogeneity.

12. **Graphical Representation (Optional)**

-   For visual representation, you can create interaction plots using `Graphs` \> `Legacy Dialogs` \> `Interaction`.

### Tips

-   Double-check your data entry to ensure accuracy.
-   If assumptions are violated, consider transformations or non-parametric alternatives.
-   Always complement quantitative findings with qualitative interpretation.

### Conclusion

This guide should assist you in conducting a 2x2 ANOVA in SPSS.

### Results

A mixed 2x2 ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of \[Between-Subject Factor Name\] (with levels \[Level 1 Name\] and \[Level 2 Name\]), \[Within-Subject Factor Name\] (with levels \[Level 1 Name\] and \[Level 2 Name\]), and their interaction on \[Dependent Variable Name\].

The main effect for the between-subjects factor, \[Between-Subject Factor Name\], was significant, F(1, N - 1) = \[F-Value\], p \< .05, η² = \[Effect Size\], indicating that \[interpret the result, e.g., participants in Level 1 of the between-subjects factor showed different scores in the dependent variable compared to participants in Level 2\].

Similarly, the main effect for the within-subjects factor, \[Within-Subject Factor Name\], was significant, F(1, N - 1) = \[F-Value\], p \< .05, η² = \[Effect Size\].
This suggests that \[interpretation, e.g., there was a significant difference in the dependent variable across the two levels of the within-subjects factor\].

Moreover, the interaction between \[Between-Subject Factor Name\] and \[Within-Subject Factor Name\] was significant, F(1, N - 1) = \[F-Value\], p \< .05, η² = \[Effect Size\].
This indicates that the effect of \[Within-Subject Factor Name\] on \[Dependent Variable Name\] varies depending on the level of \[Between-Subject Factor Name\].

To further investigate the nature of this interaction, post hoc tests were performed using \[Name of Post Hoc Test, e.g., simple effects analysis or pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment\].
The post hoc analysis revealed that \[describe the specific findings from the post hoc tests, including any significant pairwise comparisons or specific patterns observed in the interaction\].

Overall, these findings suggest that both \[Between-Subject Factor Name\] and \[Within-Subject Factor Name\] significantly affect \[Dependent Variable Name\], and their interaction provides additional insights into how these factors jointly influence the outcome.
