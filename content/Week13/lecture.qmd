## The Esteem of Science

## Perception and Scientific Observation

-   The common belief: facts about the world are directly given through
    sight
-   The reality: subjective experiences influence what we observe
-   Example: Different perceptions of the same object or scene

[*Chalmers, 2014*](source)

::: notes
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Examples Illustrating Subjective Perception

-   Children's puzzles: perception changes with experience
-   In science: learning to see through a microscope, interpreting
    X-rays

[*Chalmers, 2014*](source)

::: notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Nature of Facts in Science

-   Facts in science: not just physical realities but also statements
    describing them
-   Example: Moon's surface knowledge is derived from statements, not
    direct observation
-   The necessity of a conceptual framework for understanding facts

[*Chalmers, 2014*](source)

::: notes
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Relationship Between Facts and Theory

-   The flawed assumption that facts must precede theory
-   The importance of prior knowledge and conceptual frameworks in
    observing facts
-   Example: A botanist's ability to observe more than a layperson

[*Chalmers, 2014*](source)
